ago never leave hide plain sight billion year accord new study publish week monthly notice royal astronomical society asteroid likely around solar system form 45 billion year ago originate different star system solar system form likely closer baby star system well european southern observatory capture image lobster nebula gas dust surround young form star stars closer together nebula mean capture object close proximity star mean feel gravity much strongly early day today say fathi namouni researcher observatoire de la cte dazur lead study author statement enable asteroid pull one star system another namouni fellow researcher maria helena moreira morais universidade estadual paulista brazil use numerical modeling simulate infancy solar system pinpoint location asteroid billion year ago

solar system oumuamua first interstellar visitor solar system may form first glance 2015 bz509 just one many object orbit gas giant jupiter stable configuration call resonance though planet object solar system orbit sun move direction exoasteroid go way retrograde orbit 2015 bz509 move opposite direction asteroid jupiter take amount time complete one orbit around sun one move clockwise counterclockwise pass twice per full orbit morais write 2018 pattern repeat forever stable configuration simplify model sun jupiter asteroid see include planet still stable solar system age expect interstellar object sighting solar system researcher say orbit path object always follow mean form solar system native solar system inherit direction gas dust form planet object morais believe like newly discover alien asteroid one capture early stage solar system well exoasteroid serve warning object may enter solar system pass may also capture stable orbit case 2015 bz509 morais say search us
