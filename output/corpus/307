[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the Constitution stipulates that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years. A candidate may start running his or her campaign early before turning 35 years old or completing 14 years of residency, but must meet the age and residency requirements by [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]. The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the Constitution also sets a [[term limit]]: a president cannot be elected to more than two terms.

The U.S. Constitution also has two provisions that apply to all federal offices in general, not just the presidency. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]] states that if Congress convicts any officer on impeachment, they may also bar that person from holding any public office in the future. And [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]] prohibits the election to any federal office of any person who had held any federal or state office and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason; this disqualification can be waived if such an individual gains the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.

In addition, the Twelfth Amendment establishes that the vice-president must meet all the qualifications of being a president.

Although not a mandatory requirement, Federal campaign finance laws including the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000, among others, must first file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2nm.shtml | title=2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers | publisher=Federal Election Commission | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> This has led presidential candidates, especially members from the two major political parties, to officially announce their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising or spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.<ref name="WAPOST20150403">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/03/why-hillary-clinton-might-have-just-two-more-weeks-or-so-to-announce-shes-running-for-president/ | title=Why Hillary Clinton might have just two more weeks or so to announce she's running for president | author=Jose A.
