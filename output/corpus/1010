List of governors of Montana From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Montana) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Montana State seal Incumbent Steve Bullock since January 7, 2013 Style The Honorable Residence Montana Governor's Residence Term length Four years, renewable once (limited to eight years in a sixteen year period) Constituting instrument Montana Constitution of 1889 Inaugural holder Joseph K. Toole Formation November 8, 1889 (130 years ago) (1889-11-08) Succession Every four years, unless re-elected. Salary $108,167 (2013)[1] Website Official website The Governor of Montana is the head of the executive branch of Montana's state government[2] and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[3] The governor has a duty to enforce state laws,[2] the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Montana State Legislature,[4] to convene the legislature at any time,[5] and to grant pardons and reprieves.[6] The current Montana Constitution, ratified in 1972, calls for a 4-year term for the governor, commencing on the first Monday in January following an election.[7] The governor is term-limited to 8 years in any 16-year period.[8] The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket;[7] a provision which did not appear in the state's first constitution, ratified in 1889. In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor due to resignation, disqualification, or death, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term. If the governor is unable to perform his duties for any other reason, the lieutenant governor may become acting governor at the discretion of the state legislature.[9] The 1889 constitution made the lieutenant governor president of the state senate,[10] but this provision was removed in the 1972 constitution. Montana has had 24 governors (ten of whom were actually born within state boundaries), consisting of 9 Republicans and 15 Democrats. The longest-serving governor was Joseph Toole, who served from 1889 to 1893 and again from 1901 until his resignation in 1908 with 11 years in office. The shortest-serving governor was Elmer Holt, who served less than 13 months when the previous governor died. The current governor is Democrat Steve Bullock, who took office on January 7, 2013.
