Bush was challenged in 1992. In December 2018, the Trump campaign announced that it was merging its field operations with that of the Republican National Committee's.[3] The following month at the RNC's winter meeting in New Mexico, while acknowledging that declaring the President the party's provisional nominee would break FEC rules, the RNC voted to endorse him informally by voting to give him its "full support."[4] United States presidents[edit] U.S. Executive Branch officials[edit] Current[edit] Mike Pence Ben Carson Nikki Haley Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States 2017–present; Governor of Indiana 2013–2017; U.S. Representative from IN-6 2001–2013[5] Ben Carson, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development 2017–present; candidate for President in 2016[6] Former[edit] Nikki Haley, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations 2017–2018; Governor of South Carolina 2011–2017[7] Steve Bannon, White House Chief Strategist in 2017[8] Katie Walsh, White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Implementation in 2017[9] John McEntee, Personal Aide to the President 2017–2018[10] George Gigicos, White House Scheduling and Advance Director in 2017[11] U.S. Senators[edit] Current[edit] Lindsey Graham Ted Cruz Cory Gardner, U.S. Senator from Colorado 2015–present; U.S Representative from CO-4 2011–2015[12] Joni Ernst, U.S. Senator from Iowa 2015–present[13] Rob Portman, U.S. Senator from Ohio 2011–present[12] James Lankford, U.S. Senator from Oklahoma 2015–present; U.S. Representative from OK-5 2011–2015[14] Lindsey Graham, U.S. Senator from South Carolina 2003–present; U.S. Representative from SC-3 1995–2003; candidate for President in 2016[15] Lamar Alexander, U.S. Senator from Tennessee 2003–present; 45th Governor of Tennessee 1979–1987[16] Ted Cruz, U.S Senator from Texas 2013–present; Solicitor General of Texas 2003–2008; candidate for President in 2016[17] Mike Lee, U.S. Senator from Utah 2011–present[18] U.S. Representatives[edit] Current[edit] Ted Yoho, U.S. Representative from FL-3 2013–present[19] Don Bacon, U.S. Representative from NE-2 2017–present[20] Jeff Van Drew, U.S. Representative from NJ-02 2019–present[21] (former Democrat) John Katko, U.S. Representative from NY-24 2015–present[22] Jim Jordan, U.S. Representative from OH-04 2007–present[23] Governors[edit] Current[edit] Tate Reeves, Governor of Mississippi 2020–present[24] Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina 2017–present[15] Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas 2015–present[25] Jim Justice, Governor of West Virginia 2017–present (former Democrat)[26] Former[edit] Rod Blagojevich, Governor of Illinois 2003–2009 (Democrat)[27] Paul LePage, Governor of Maine 2011–2019[28] Chris Christie, Governor of New Jersey 2010–2018, candidate for President in 2016[29] Scott Walker, Governor of Wisconsin 2011–2019, candidate for President in 2016[30] Statewide officials[edit] Current[edit] Jeanette Núñez, Lieutenant Governor of Florida 2019–present[31] George P.
