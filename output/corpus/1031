List of governors of Florida From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Florida) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikimedia list article Governor of Florida Great Seal of the State of Florida Incumbent Ron DeSantis since January 8, 2019 Style The Honorable Residence Florida Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, renewable once Inaugural holder William Dunn Moseley Formation June 25, 1845 Deputy Jeanette Núñez, lieutenant governor Salary $130,273 (2013)[1] Website www.flgov.com The governor of Florida is the head of the executive branch of Florida's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[2] The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Florida Legislature,[3] to convene the legislature,[4] and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment.[5] When Florida was first acquired by the United States, future president Andrew Jackson served as its military governor. Florida Territory was established in 1822, and five people served as governor over 6 distinct terms. The first territorial governor, William Pope Duval, served 12 years, the longest of any Florida governor to date. Since statehood in 1845, there have been 45 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Four state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints; and Reubin Askew, Jeb Bush, and Rick Scott who each served their terms consecutively. Bob Graham almost served two terms, as he resigned with only three days left. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three days following the resignation of his predecessor, Bob Graham. The current governor is Ron DeSantis, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 8, 2019.

Spanish Florida was acquired from Spain in the Adams–Onís Treaty, which took effect July 10, 1821.[6] Parts of West Florida had already been assigned to Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi; the remainder and East Florida were governed by a military commissioner with the powers of governor until the territory was organized and incorporated.[7] Federal Military Commissioner of Florida Commissioner Term in office Appointed by Notes Andrew Jackson March 10, 1821 – December 31, 1821 James Monroe [a][b] Governors of the Territory of Florida[edit] Florida Territory was organized on March 30, 1822, combining East and West Florida.[12] Governors of the Territory of Florida No. Governor Term in office Appointed by 1 William Pope Duval April 17, 1822 – April 24, 1834 James Monroe John Quincy Adams Andrew Jackson 2 John Eaton April 24, 1834 – March 16, 1836 3 Richard K.

Call March 19, 1841 – August 11, 1844 William Henry Harrison John Tyler 6 John Branch August 11, 1844 – June 25, 1845 Governors of the State of Florida[edit] The State of Florida was admitted to the Union on March 3, 1845. It seceded from the Union on January 10, 1861,[13] and joined the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861,[14] as a founding member. Following the end of the American Civil War, it was part of the Third Military District.[15] Florida was readmitted to the Union on June 25, 1868.[16] The Florida Constitution of 1838 provided that a governor be elected every 4 years, who was not allowed to serve consecutive terms.[17] The secessionist constitution of 1861 would have reduced this to two years and removed the term limit,[18] but the state fell to the Union before the first election under that constitution. The rejected constitution of 1865 and the ratified constitution of 1868 maintained the four-year term,[19][20] though without the earlier term limit, which was reintroduced in the 1885 constitution.[21] The current constitution of 1968 states that should the governor serve, or would have served had he not resigned, more than six years in two consecutive terms, he cannot be elected to the succeeding term.[22] The start of a term was set in 1885 at the first Tuesday after the first Monday in the January following the election,[21] where it has remained.[23] Originally, the president of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant.[24] The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor,[25][26] who would similarly act as governor. This office was abolished in 1885, with the president of the senate again taking on that duty.[27] The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor.[28] The governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.[22] Florida was a strongly Democratic state before the Civil War, electing only one candidate from the Whig party (the Democrat's chief opposition at the time).[29] It elected three Republican governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 90 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

The most recent death of a former governor was that of Reubin Askew (served 1971–1979, born 1928), on March 13, 2014. The most recent-serving governor to die was Lawton Chiles (served 1991–1998, born 1930), who died while still in office on December 12, 1998. The living former governors, in order of service, are: Governor Gubernatorial term Date of birth (and age) Bob Graham 1979–1987 (1936-11-09) November 9, 1936 (age 83) Wayne Mixson 1987 (1922-06-16) June 16, 1922 (age 97) Bob Martinez 1987–1991 (1934-12-25) December 25, 1934 (age 85) Buddy MacKay 1998–1999 (1933-03-22) March 22, 1933 (age 87) Jeb Bush 1999–2007 (1953-02-11) February 11, 1953 (age 67) Charlie Crist 2007–2011 (1956-07-24) July 24, 1956 (age 63) Rick Scott 2011–2019 (1952-12-01) December 1, 1952 (age 67) Line of succession[edit] See also: Gubernatorial lines of succession in the United States § Florida Since 2003, the line of succession to the office of governor has been as follows:[42] Lieutenant Governor, currently Jeanette Núñez Attorney General, currently Ashley Moody Chief Financial Officer, currently Jimmy Patronis Commissioner of Agriculture, currently Nikki Fried Whenever the governor is unable or unwilling to discharge the office, either temporarily or permanently, the lieutenant governor takes over all the duties of the governorship either until the governor is able to resume the office or until the next election. At any time that the governor is on trial for impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes the acting governor. Additionally, at any time that three members of the cabinet and the chief justice of the Supreme Court agree on the governor's mental or physical unfitness for office, they may suspend and reinstate the governor, pursuant to Article IV, Section 3 of the Florida Constitution. If a vacancy occurs in the office of governor and a successor within the above-stated line of succession can not fill the vacancy, the speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and the president of the Senate must convene the Legislature by joint proclamation within 15 days for the purpose of choosing a person to serve as governor for the remainder of the term. A successor can only be chosen by a majority vote in a joint session of both houses.[43] If, after the appointment of a lieutenant governor, a vacancy occurs in the office of governor with more than 28 months remaining in the term and the appointed lieutenant governor becomes governor, voters must choose a governor and lieutenant governor to serve out the remainder of the terms at the next general election.[43] See also[edit] List of Florida state legislatures Notes[edit] ^ Jackson's official titles were "Commissioner of the United States" and "Governor of East and West Florida".[8] ^ Jackson left Florida on October 8, 1821.[9] His resignation was submitted on November 13, 1821,[10] and the president accepted it on December 31, 1821.[11] ^ Data is sourced from the National Governors Association, unless supplemental references are required. ^ The office of lieutenant governor was created in 1868,[25] abolished in 1885,[27] and recreated in 1968.[28] ^ Lieutenant governors represented the same party as their governor unless noted. ^ Milton committed suicide due to the pending defeat of the Confederate States of America, stating in his final address to the legislature that "death would be preferable to reunion."[30] ^ Allison resigned to go into hiding from approaching Union troops, and was captured by them on June 19, 1865.[31] ^ Marvin was appointed provisional governor by the Union occupation.[32] ^ Most sources state Walker was a Democrat; the state archives say he was "Conservative".[33] ^ Represented the Republican Party ^ Reed was popularly elected under the terms of the 1868 constitution, and took the oath of office on June 8, 1868; it was not until July 4, 1868, however, that the federal commander of Florida, still under Reconstruction, recognized the validity of the state constitution and the election.[34] ^ During an attempted impeachment of Reed, Gleason proclaimed himself governor. The Supreme Court eventually sided with Reed, and Gleason was removed from office.[35] ^ Appointed as temporary lieutenant governor to replace William Henry Gleason. However, the state comptroller did not believe the governor could appoint a replacement to an elected office and refused to pay Weeks, and the Senate refused to accept his presidency over them, even proposing a motion to arrest him. Governor Reed called for a special election to replace him, and though Weeks fought it, the Florida Supreme Court declared his term to have ended when the new election results were certified.[36] ^ Special election to fill the remainder of McCarty's term[37] ^ This term was only two years as the election schedule was changed so that it would not coincide with presidential elections.[38] ^ Graham resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[39] ^ MacKay was a candidate in the 1998 election but lost; he succeeded Lawton Chiles after the election but before his successor took office. ^ Crist was elected as a member of the Republican Party, and switched to independent in April 2010.[40] ^ Due to Ron DeSantis and Jeannette Núñez taking their oath of office ahead of time, they became governor and lieutenant governor at midnight on January 8, rather than waiting for an inauguration ceremony. Thus, Scott and Lopez-Cantera's terms ended at the end of January 7.[41] ^ DeSantis' current term expires on January 2, 2023. References[edit] General "Former Florida Governors".
