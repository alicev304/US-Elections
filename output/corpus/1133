W. F. Turner From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search William F. Turner (circa 1891, Crenshaw County, Alabama – January 3, 1958, Montgomery, Alabama)[1] was a Montgomery accountant and a United States Democratic elector from Alabama during the 1956 United States presidential election. 1956 presidential election[edit] He is remembered as a faithless elector.[2] Although he pledged to vote for the Democratic ticket - Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson and his running-mate Estes Kefauver, he cast his presidential vote on December 17, 1956 for a circuit court judge from his hometown, Walter Burgwyn Jones, totally unknown outside his area. He was allowed to do so thanks to a 1949 Supreme Court of Alabama ruling stating electors were free agents.[1] However, Turner voted for well-known United States Senator from Georgia Herman Talmadge for Vice President, after being told by others his first choice, John Malcolm Patterson, was not possible because of the need of the presidential ticket being taken from two different states.[1] When fellow elector Tom Cochrane confronted him about "[his] obligation", Turner replied "I have fulfilled my obligations to the people of Alabama. I'm talking about the white people", a comment which suggested that he opposed Stevenson and Kefauver, who were liberal on civil rights (unlike Jones and Senator Talmadge, known for their pro-segregationist stance).[3][4] Aftermath[edit] Turner died on January 3, 1958 in Montgomery, aged 66.[1] References[edit] ^ a b c d "William F.
