In 1844, Representative [[Samuel Finley Vinton|Samuel F. Vinton]] of Ohio proposed an amendment to the constitution that would replace the electoral college system with a lot system. The Joint Resolution called for each state to elect, by a simple majority, a presidential candidate of said state. Each state would notify Congress of the presidential election results. Congress would then inscribe the name of every state on uniform balls, equal to the number of said state's members of Congress, and deposit into a box. In a joint session of Congress, a ball would be drawn, and the elected candidate of the state of which is written on the drawn ball would be named president. A second ball would immediately be drawn after, and that state's candidate would be named vice-president. The resolution did not pass the House. Representative Vinton proposed an identical amendment in 1846. Again, it was unsuccessful. The driving force behind the introduction of the resolution is unclear, as there is no recorded debate for either proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24200386|title=House Joint Resolution (H.J.

Other constitutional amendments, such as the [[Electoral College abolition amendment|Every Vote Counts Amendment]], have been proposed seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, which proponents argue would increase turnout and participation. Other proposed reforms include the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[interstate compact]] without Congressional authorization, whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote, instead of voting their respective statewide results. Another proposal is for every state to simply adopt the District system used by Maine and Nebraska: give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district. The Automatic Plan would replace the Electors with an automatic tallying of votes to eliminate the faithless elector affecting the outcome of the election. The Proportional Plan, often compared to the District Plan, would distribute electoral votes in each state in proportion to the popular vote, introducing third party effects in election outcomes. The House Plan would require a constitutional amendment to allocate electors based on the House apportionment alone to lessen small state advantage. Direct election plans and bonus plans have in common a higher valuation on the popular vote for president.<ref>Melcher, James P., "[https://www.academia.edu/1536978/Electing_to_Reform_Maine_and_the_District_Plan_for_Selection_of_Presidential_Electors Electing to Reform: Maine and the District Plan for Selection of Presidential Electors]", 2004, New England Political Science Association. viewed October 23, 2014.</ref>
