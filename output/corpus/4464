It hosts meetings and is the primary forum for communicating the party's message to members. The Conference produces a daily publication of political analysis under the title Legislative Digest. The conference has a chair who directs day-to-day operations and who is assisted by an elected vice chair and a secretary. The current chair is Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who assumed the position in 2019.[1] In the 112th Congress, the chair was Jeb Hensarling of Texas, the vice chair was Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, and the secretary was John Carter of Texas. For the 113th Congress (2013–2015), the party elected Cathy McMorris Rodgers as the Chair after a tough fight with conservative Tom Price of Georgia. They also elected Lynn Jenkins of Kansas to the position of Vice Chair and Virginia Foxx of North Carolina to the position of Secretary.[2] Former chairs include Gerald Ford, John Boehner, Mike Pence, John B. Anderson, Dick Cheney, Jack Kemp, J. C. Watts, Deborah D. Pryce, and Adam Putnam.
