{{Politics of the United States}}

The '''election of the president and the vice president of the United States''' is an [[indirect election]] in which [[Citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]] who are [[Voter registration in the United States|registered to vote]] in one of the fifty [[U.S. state]]s or in [[Washington, D.C.]], cast ballots not directly for those offices, but instead for members of the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]].{{NoteTag|Individual states select electors by methods decided at the state level. Since 1836, all states have selected electors by statewide popular vote. See the [[United States Electoral College]] article for more information.}} These electors then in turn cast direct votes, known as electoral votes, for [[president of the United States|president]], and for [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. The candidate who receives an [[absolute majority]] of electoral votes (at least 270 out of a total of 538, since the [[Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-Third Amendment]] granted voting rights to citizens of D.C.) is then elected to that office. If no candidate receives an absolute majority of the votes for president, the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] chooses the winner; if no one receives an absolute majority of the votes for vice president, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] chooses the winner.

The Electoral College and its procedure are established in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] by [[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II, Section 1, Clauses 2 and 4]]; and the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] (which replaced Clause{{nbsp}}3 after its ratification in 1804). Under Clause{{nbsp}}2, each of the states casts as many electoral votes as the total number of its Senators and Representatives in [[United States Congress|Congress]], while (per the Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961) Washington, D.C., casts the same number of electoral votes as the least-represented state, which is three. Also under Clause{{nbsp}}2, the manner for choosing electors is determined by each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], not directly by the federal government. Many state legislatures previously selected their electors directly, but over time all of them switched to using the [[Direct election|popular vote]] to determine electors, which persists today. Once chosen, electors generally cast their electoral votes for the candidate who won the [[Plurality voting|plurality]] in their state, but 18 states do not have provisions that specifically address this behavior; those who vote in opposition to the plurality are known as "[[Faithless elector|faithless]]" or "[[Unpledged elector|unpledged]]" electors.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Robert G., Jr.|title=Electoral College Procedure|jstor=443484|journal=The Western Political Quarterly|volume=3|issue=2|year=1950|doi=10.2307/443484}}</ref> In modern times, faithless and unpledged electors have not affected the ultimate outcome of an election, so the results can generally be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote.

[[Presidential election]]s occur [[wikt:quadrennial|quadrennially]] with registered voters casting their ballots on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], which since 1845 has been the first Tuesday after November 1.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|3|1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Caldwell|first1=Leigh Ann|title=A Viewer's Guide to the Next Year in Presidential Politics|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/viewers-guide-next-year-presidential-politics-n455971|accessdate=November 8, 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=November 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Cohen|first1=Andrew|title=Could a Hurricane Like Sandy Postpone the Presidential Election?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/could-a-hurricane-like-sandy-postpone-the-presidential-election/264254/|accessdate=November 8, 2015|magazine=The Atlantic|date=October 29, 2012}}</ref> This date coincides with the general elections of various other federal, state, and local races; since local governments are responsible for managing elections, these races typically all appear on one ballot. The Electoral College electors then formally cast their electoral votes on the first Monday after December 12 at their respective state capitals. Congress then certifies the results in early January, and the presidential term begins on [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], which since the passage of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] has been set at January 20.

The nomination process, consisting of the [[United States presidential primary|primary elections and caucuses]] and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating conventions]], was not specified in the Constitution, but was developed over time by the states and [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]]. These primary elections are generally held between January and June before the general election in November, while the nominating conventions are held in the summer. Though not codified by law, political parties also follow an indirect election process, where voters in the fifty states, Washington, D.C., and [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]], cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. Each party may then choose a vice presidential [[running mate]] to join the ticket, which is either determined by choice of the nominee or by a second round of voting. Because of changes to national campaign finance laws since the 1970s regarding the disclosure of contributions for federal campaigns, presidential candidates from the major political parties usually declare their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year before the election (almost 21 months before Inauguration Day).<ref name="WAPOST20150403"/>

==History==
Article Two of the Constitution originally established the method of presidential elections, including the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the Congress to choose the president, and those who preferred a national popular vote.<ref>{{cite book |first = Gary |last = Bugh |title=Electoral College Reform: Challenges and Possibilities |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC |year=2010 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-7751-2 |page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC&pg=PA40 40] }}</ref>

Each state is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the ratification of the Twenty-third Amendment in 1961, the District of Columbia is also granted a number of electors, equal to the number of those held by the least populous state. However, U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College.

Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature; Article{{nbsp}}II, Section{{nbsp}}1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 states that each state shall appoint electors "in such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct".<ref>[[Richard A. Epstein]], [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5103&context=uclrev {{"'}}In Such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct": The Outcome in ''Bush v Gore'' Defended], 68 ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 613, 614 (2001).</ref> During [[1788–89 United States presidential election|the first presidential election in 1789]], only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote.{{NoteTag|Of the 13 original states during the [[1788–89 United States presidential election|1789 election]], six states chose electors by some form of popular vote, four states chose electors by a different method, [[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]] were ineligible to participate since they had not yet ratified the U.S. Constitution, and [[New York (state)|New York]] failed to appoint their allotment of electors in time because of a deadlock in their state legislature.}} Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to choose their slate of electors. In 1800, only five of the 16 states chose electors by a popular vote; by 1824, after the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]], the proportion of states that chose electors by popular vote had sharply risen to 18 out of 24 states.<ref name="Norton">Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation: A History of the United States'', Vol. I (11th ed. 2019), p. 340.</ref> This gradual movement toward greater [[democratization]] coincided with a gradual decrease in [[Voting rights in the United States|property restrictions for the franchise]].<ref name="Norton"/> By [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], only one of the 26 states ([[South Carolina]]) still selected electors by the state legislature.<ref>Donald Richard Deskins, Hanes Walton & Sherman C. Puckett, ''Presidential Elections, 1789–2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data'' (University of Michigan Press, 2010), p. 117.</ref>

Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate became the vice president. This presented a problem during the [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]] when [[Aaron Burr]] received the same number of electoral votes as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and challenged Jefferson's election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the president because of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s influence in the House.

In response to the 1800 election, the Twelfth Amendment was passed, requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for president and another for vice president. While this solved the problem at hand, it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the vice presidency, as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the presidency. The separate ballots for president and vice president became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a state's Electoral College delegation. Electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate (offered by the same political party). So, while the Constitution says the president and vice president are chosen separately, in practice they are chosen together.

The Twelfth Amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College. In the [[1824 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1824]], [[Andrew Jackson]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election was thrown to the House, and [[John Quincy Adams]] was elected president. A deep rivalry resulted between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]], who had also been a candidate in the election.

Since 1824, aside from the occasional "faithless elector", the popular vote determines the winner of a presidential election by determining the electoral vote, as each state or district's popular vote determines its electoral college vote. Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who is the victor. In 53 of the 58 total elections held so far (about 91 percent), the winner of the national popular vote has also carried the Electoral College vote. The winners of the nationwide popular vote and the Electoral College vote differ only in close elections. In highly competitive elections, candidates focus on turning out their vote in the contested swing states critical to winning an electoral college majority, so they do not try to maximize their popular vote by real or fraudulent vote increases in one-party areas.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282575990_The_Ten_Most_Competitive_American_Presidential_Elections |title=The Ten Most Competitive American Presidential Elections |first=Douglas Dana |last=Rose |work=ResearchGate }}</ref>

However, candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a presidential election and still win. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to the Twelfth Amendment, the House must choose the president out of the top three people in the election. Clay had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won. Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay. Charges of a "corrupt bargain" followed Adams through his term.

{{legend|red|Republican}}{{legend|blue|Democrat}}{{legend|grey|All other candidates together}}]]

Then in [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], the winner of the electoral vote lost the popular vote outright. Numerous [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] have been submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of Congress. Another alternate proposal is the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[interstate compact]] whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.

The presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in the month of November because of the factors involved (weather, harvests and worship). When voters used to travel to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on Sunday, ride to their [[county seat]] on Monday, and vote on Tuesday—all before market day, Wednesday. The month of November also fits nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather, which could be especially bad to people traveling by [[horse and buggy]].<ref name="election history facts CNN">{{cite web |last=Yan|first=Holly|title=Why Tuesday, why November, why elephants? Election riddles solved|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/06/politics/fun-election-facts/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=6 November 2012}}</ref>

Until 1937, presidents were not sworn in until March 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's logistical issues in moving to the capital. With improvements in transportation and the passage of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], presidential inaugurations were moved forward to noon on January 20, thereby allowing presidents to start their duties sooner.<ref name="election history facts CNN"/>

The [[Federal Election Campaign Act|Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] was enacted to increase disclosure of [[Campaign finance in the United States|contributions for federal campaigns]]. Subsequent amendments to law require that candidates to a federal office must file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]] before they can receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000. Thus, this began a trend of presidential candidates declaring their intentions to run as early as the Spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising and spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.<ref name="WAPOST20150403" />

The first president, [[George Washington]], was elected as an [[Independent politician|independent]]. Since the election of his successor, [[John Adams]], in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], all winners of U.S. presidential elections have represented one of two major parties. [[Third party (United States)|Third parties]] have taken second place only twice, in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] and [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. The last time a third (independent) candidate achieved significant success (although still finishing in third place) was [[Ross Perot]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], and the last time a third-party candidate received any electoral votes not from [[faithless elector]]s was [[George Wallace]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]].

==Procedure==
===Eligibility requirements===
[[File:NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The hand-written copy of the [[natural-born-citizen clause]] as it appeared in 1787]]

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the Constitution stipulates that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years. A candidate may start running his or her campaign early before turning 35 years old or completing 14 years of residency, but must meet the age and residency requirements by [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]. The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the Constitution also sets a [[term limit]]: a president cannot be elected to more than two terms.

The U.S. Constitution also has two provisions that apply to all federal offices in general, not just the presidency. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]] states that if Congress convicts any officer on impeachment, they may also bar that person from holding any public office in the future. And [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]] prohibits the election to any federal office of any person who had held any federal or state office and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason; this disqualification can be waived if such an individual gains the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.

In addition, the Twelfth Amendment establishes that the vice-president must meet all the qualifications of being a president.

Although not a mandatory requirement, Federal campaign finance laws including the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000, among others, must first file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2nm.shtml | title=2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers | publisher=Federal Election Commission | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> This has led presidential candidates, especially members from the two major political parties, to officially announce their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising or spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.<ref name="WAPOST20150403">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/03/why-hillary-clinton-might-have-just-two-more-weeks-or-so-to-announce-shes-running-for-president/ | title=Why Hillary Clinton might have just two more weeks or so to announce she's running for president | author=Jose A. DelReal | work=Washington Post | date=April 3, 2015 | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> Potential candidates usually form [[exploratory committee]]s even earlier to determining the feasibility of them actually running.

===Decentralized election system and voter eligibility===
{{see|Elections in the United States|Voting rights in the United States|Voter registration in the United States}}

The U.S. presidential election process, like all other [[elections in the United States]], is a highly decentralized system.<ref name="NCSL">{{cite web|title=Election Administration at State and Local Levels|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> While the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] does set parameters for the election of the president and other federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including the primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), and the specific details of running each state's electoral college meeting. All elections, including federal, are administered by the individual states.<ref name="whitehouse">{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/elections-and-voting |title=Elections & Voting |website=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>

Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government. Candidates must submit separate filings in each of the 50 states if they want to qualify on each state's ballot, and the requirements for filing vary by state.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/time-running-short-for-new-2020-democrats-to-jump-in-as-filing-deadlines-approach|title=Time running short for new 2020 Democrats to jump in as filing deadlines approach |newspaper=Washington Examiner |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>

The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th]] and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th]] Amendments to the Constitution state that [[suffrage]] cannot be denied on grounds of race or color, sex, or age for citizens eighteen years or older, respectively. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility and registration.<ref name="whitehouse"/> And the specific requirements for voter eligibility and registration also vary by state, e.g. some states ban convicted felons from voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|website=Learning.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Nominating process===
{{main|United States presidential primary|United States presidential nominating convention}}

[[File:Madison Square Garden, February 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], the site of the 1976, 1980, and 1992 Democratic National Conventions; and the 2004 Republican National Convention.]]
[[File:RNC-interior-Palin-20080903.jpg|thumb|The floor of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].]]

The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections consists of two major parts: a series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] held in each state, and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] held by each [[political party]]. This process was never included in the Constitution, and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.

The [[primary election]]s are run by state and local governments, while the [[caucus]]es are organized directly by the political parties. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered generally between January and June before the federal election, with [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary, respectively.

Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates "bound" to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention.

Unlike the general election, voters in the U.S. territories can also elect delegates to the national conventions. Furthermore, each political party can determine how many delegates to allocate to each state and territory. In 2012 for example, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party conventions each used two different formulas to allocate delegates. The Democrats-based theirs on two main factors: the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the previous three presidential elections, and the number of electoral votes each state had in the Electoral College.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates">{{cite web|url=https://thegreenpapers.com/P12/D-Alloc.phtml|title=Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> In contrast, the Republicans assigned to each state 10 delegates, plus three delegates per congressional district.<ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates">{{cite web|url=https://thegreenpapers.com/P12/R-Alloc.phtml|title=Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Both parties then gave a fixed number of delegates to each territory, and finally bonus delegates to states and territories that passed certain criteria.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"/><ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates"/>

Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state and U.S. territory delegations to both the Democratic and Republican party conventions also include "unpledged" delegates who have a vote. For Republicans, they consist of the three top party officials from each state and territory. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called "[[superdelegate]]s", who are party leaders and elected officials.

Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with him or her on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention.

If no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates (including both pledged and unpledged), then a "[[brokered convention]]" results. All pledged delegates are then "released" and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate. Thereafter, the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political [[horse trading]], and additional rounds of re-votes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Paul |work=Newsweek |date=2008-02-07 |title=Convention Wisdom |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/109264 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Convention Q & A |last=Eun Kyung Kim |work=Gannett News Service |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=2008-02-10 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080210/NEWS15/802100609/1009/NEWS07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/108729 |title=A Ticking Clock |first=Eleanor |last=Clift |date=2008-02-06 |work=Newsweek }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080209/NEWS01/80209008/0/towns63 |title=Post-primary questions answered |date=2008-02-09 |first=Jeffrey |last=Gold |work=Associated Press |publisher=Courier-Post }}</ref>

The conventions have historically been held inside [[convention center]]s, but since the late 20th century both the Democratic and Republican parties have favored [[Arena|sports arenas]] and domed stadiums to accommodate the increasing attendance.

===The popular vote on Election Day===
[[File:Larsz - US election 08 (by-sa).jpg|left|thumb|A Texas voter about to mark a selection for president on a ballot, 2008 Election Day]]

Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature. Although each state designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed. For instance, instead of having a popular vote, a number of states used to select presidential electors by a direct vote of the state legislature itself.

However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November," i.e., a Tuesday no earlier than November{{nbsp}}2 and no later than November{{nbsp}}8.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sandy unlikely to postpone election|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2012/10/30/sandy-obama-romney-election/1668501/|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> Today, the states and the District of Columbia each conduct their own popular elections on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] to help determine their respective slate of electors.

Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for the electors of a candidate" meaning the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate.

Many voting ballots allow a voter to "blanket vote" for all candidates in a particular [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]] or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as [[Ballot access in the United States|ballot access]]. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for president, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided enough voters have endorsed that candidate, usually through a signature list.

The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a [[write-in candidate]]. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as [[Mickey Mouse]] or comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.

Because U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for president. [[Guam]] has held [[straw poll]]s for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.<ref name="guammove">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/07/10/guam-legislature-moves-general-election-presidential-vote-to-the-september-primary/ |title=Guam Legislature Moves General Election Presidential Vote to the September Primary |publisher=Ballot-Access.org |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

===Electoral college===

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in 30 states (red) and in [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] to capture 306 electoral votes. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]] won the popular vote in 20 states (blue) plus D.C. to capture 232 electoral votes. Of these, seven were cast by [[Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidential election|faithless electors]]—two pledged to Trump and five pledged to Clinton—for other persons.]]

Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] do not use this method, instead giving two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president. Although Electoral College members can vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 32 [[U.S. state|states]] plus the [[District of Columbia]] have laws against [[faithless elector]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> those electors who do not cast their electoral votes for the person for whom they have pledged to vote. Two [[Faithless_elector#U.S._Supreme_Court|cases]] questioning the constitutionality of these laws are currently pending before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting vice president, acting in his capacity as [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]], and read aloud to a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.

If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the Twelfth Amendment. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a [[contingent election]] in a ballot of the House of Representatives. For the purposes of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of the Senate is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote. The House has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice, in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]] and [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; the Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once, in [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]].

If the president is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect acts as president. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as president, pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment.

Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the "[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]]" (unless it is a sitting president who has won re-election).

===Election calendar===

[[File:John Adams crop.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]] was the first of 26 presidents who have been lawyers.]]

Among the 44 persons who have served as president, only [[Donald Trump]] had never held a position in either government or the military prior to taking office.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/23/525111191/trump-s-first-100-days-an-entry-level-presidency | title=Trump's First 100 Days: An 'Entry-Level' Presidency | publisher=NPR | first=Domenico | last=Montanaro | date=April 23, 2017 | accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> The only previous experience [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had was in the military. [[Herbert Hoover]] previously served as the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. Everyone else served in elected public office before becoming president, such as being Vice President, a member of Congress, or a state or territorial governor.

Fourteen Presidents also served as vice president. However, only John Adams ([[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]), Thomas Jefferson ([[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]), [[Martin Van Buren]] ([[1836 United States presidential election|1836]]), [[Richard Nixon]] ([[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]) and [[George H. W. Bush]] ([[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]) began their first term after winning an election. The remaining nine began their first term as president according to the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] after the intra-term death or resignation of their predecessor. Of these, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] were subsequently elected to a full term of their own, while [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], and [[Gerald Ford]] were not. Ford's accession to the presidency is unique in American history in that he became vice president through the process prescribed by the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] rather than by winning an election, thus making him the only U.S. president to not have been elected to either office.

Sixteen presidents had previously served in the U.S. Senate, including four of the five who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only three were incumbent senators at the time they were elected president ([[Warren G. Harding]] in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]). Eighteen presidents had earlier served in the House of Representatives. However, only one was a sitting representative when elected to presidency ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]]).

Four of the last seven presidents ([[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]]) have been governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either very large states (Reagan from [[California]], Bush from [[Texas]]) or from a state south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] and east of Texas (Carter from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Clinton from [[Arkansas]]). In all, sixteen presidents have been former governors, including seven who were incumbent governors at the time of their election to the presidency.

The most common job experience, occupation or profession of U.S. presidents has been lawyer;<ref>International Law, US Power: The United States' Quest for Legal Security, p. 10, Shirley V. Scott (2012)</ref> 26 presidents had served as attorneys. Twenty-two presidents were also in the military. Eight presidents had served as Cabinet Secretaries, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841 having held the office of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]].

After leaving office, one president, [[William Howard Taft]], served as [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. Two others later served in Congress{{snd}}John Quincy Adams in the House and Andrew Johnson in the Senate.

===Technology and media===
{{see also|Social media in the 2016 United States presidential election}}
[[File:Commercial-LBJ1964ElectionAdDaisyGirl.ogv|thumb|upright=1.15|thumbtime=3|Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 "Daisy" advertisement]]

Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. The invention of radio and then television gave way to the reliance of national political advertisements such as Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", Ronald Reagan's 1984 "[[Morning in America]]", and George H. W. Bush's 1988 "[[Revolving Door (advertisement)|Revolving Door]]", all of which became major factors. In 1992, George H. W. Bush's promise of "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" was extensively used in the commercials of Bill Clinton and Bush's other opponents with significant effect during the campaign.

Since the development of the internet in the mid-90s, [[Internet activism]] has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000. The internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009">{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Chesebro|first2=James W.|last3=Studinski|first3=David Paul|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5|pages=574–88|doi=10.1080/10510970903260418}}</ref> It was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

In 2000, both candidates (George W. Bush and [[Al Gore]]) created, maintained and updated campaign websites. But it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the internet seen. By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites.<ref name=Endres>{{cite journal|last=Endres, Warnick|title=Text-based Interactivity in Candidate Campaign Web Sites: A case Study from the 2002 Elections|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=68|issue=3|pages=322–42|doi=10.1080/10570310409374804}}</ref> [[Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign|Howard Dean's]] campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy.<ref name=Endres/> It allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with the campaign, and connect with other supporters.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/> A [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the internet to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said they use the internet to get this information frequently.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

Use of the [[Internet]] for [[grassroots fundraising]] by US presidential candidates such as [[Howard Dean]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] established it as an effective political tool. In 2016, the use of [[social media]] was a key part of [[Donald Trump]] campaign. Trump and his opinions were established as constantly “trending” by posting multiple times per day, and his strong online influence was constantly reinforced.<ref name=diggit>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.diggitmagazine.com/articles/Trump-Twitter-Based-Presidency|title=Trump, social media and the first Twitter-based Presidency|date=July 5, 2018|magazine=diggit magazine}}</ref> Internet channels such as [[YouTube]] were used by candidates to share speeches and ads and to attack candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

A study done by the [[Pew]] Internet & American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54% of adults in the [[United States]] used the internet to get information about the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]] and about specific candidates. This represents 73% of adult internet users. The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used [[List of social networking websites|social network]] sites or [[Twitter]] to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=Pew Internet & American Life Project|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/The-Internet-and-Campaign-2010.aspx|work=The Internet and Campaign 2010|publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref>

E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little regulation. On March 26, 2006, the [[Federal Election Commission]] voted unanimously to "not regulate political communication on the Internet, including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sites"<ref name="Bimbaum">{{cite news|last=Bimbaum|first=Jeffrey|title=Loophole a Spigot for E-Mail; Critics Fear Voters Will Be Deluged as Fall Elections Near|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 11, 2006}}</ref> This decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trent & Friedenberg|title=Political Campaign Communication Principles & Practices|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD}}</ref> A comment was made about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. which explains this loophole in the context of a political campaign: "A wealthy individual could purchase all of the [[Email|e-mail]] addresses for registered [[Voting|voters]] in a [[congressional district]]{{nbsp}}... produce an Internet video ad, and [[e-mail]] it along with a link to the campaign contribution page{{nbsp}}... Not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reported."<ref name="Bimbaum"/>

A key part of the [[United States]] presidential campaigns is the use of media and framing. Candidates are able to frame their opponents and current issues in ways to affect the way voters will see events and the other presidential candidates.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/upshot/big-picture-with-trump-vs-clinton-is-all-in-the-framing.html|title=Big Picture for Trump vs. Clinton?

Trump primed voters to think of Clinton as ‘Crooked Hillary,’ or a ‘Nasty Woman,’ etc. The tactic of priming refers to the way that viewers’ opinions can be influenced.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12184766/media-boost-donald-trump-coverage|title=Yes, blame the media for Donald Trump.

The presidential election process is controversial, with critics arguing that it is inherently undemocratic, and discourages voter participation and turnout in many areas of the country. Because of the staggered nature of the primary season, voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other small states which traditionally hold their primaries and caucuses first in January usually have a major impact on the races. Campaign activity, media attention, and voter participation are usually higher in these states, as the candidates attempt to build momentum and generate a [[bandwagon effect]] in these early primaries. Conversely, voters in California and other large states which traditionally hold their primaries last in June usually end up having no say in who the presidential candidates will be. The races are usually over by then, and thus the campaigns, the media, and voters have little incentive to participate in these late primaries. As a result, more states vie for earlier primaries to claim a greater influence in the process. However, compressing the primary calendar in this way limits the ability of lesser-known candidates to effectively corral resources and raise their visibility among voters, especially when competing with better-known candidates who have more financial resources and the institutional backing of their party's establishment. Primary and caucus reform proposals include a [[National primary|National Primary]] held on a single day; or the [[Interregional Primary Plan]], where states would be grouped into six regions, and each of the regions would rotate every election on who would hold their primaries first.

With the primary races usually over before June, the political conventions have mostly become scripted, ceremonial affairs. As the drama has left the conventions, and complaints grown that they were scripted and dull pep rallies, public interest and viewership has fallen off. After having offered gavel-to-gavel coverage of the major party conventions in the mid-20th century, the [[Big Three television networks]] now devote only approximately three hours of coverage (one hour per night).

Critics also argue that the Electoral College is archaic and inherently undemocratic. With all states, except Maine and Nebraska, using a winner-take-all system, both the Democratic and the Republican candidates are almost certain to win all the electoral votes from those states whose residents predominantly vote for the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, respectively. This encourages presidential candidates to focus exponentially more time, money, and energy campaigning in a few so-called "[[swing state]]s", states in which no single candidate or party has overwhelming support. Such swing states like Ohio are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates. Meanwhile, candidates and political parties have no incentive to mount nationwide campaign efforts, or work to increase voter turnout, in predominantly Democratic Party "safe states" like California or predominantly Republican Party "safe states" like Texas. In practice, the winner-take-all system also both reinforces the country's [[two-party system]] and decreases the importance of [[Third party (United States)|third and minor political parties]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109153753/http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/4312|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 9, 2009|title=Third Parties?|author=Jerry Fresia|date=February 28, 2006|publisher=Zmag.org|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, a candidate can win the electoral vote without securing the greatest amount of the national popular vote, such as during the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]] elections. In theory, it is possible to secure the necessary 270 electoral votes from only the eleven most populous states and then ignore the rest of the country.

===Proposed changes to the election process===
In 1844, Representative [[Samuel Finley Vinton|Samuel F. Vinton]] of Ohio proposed an amendment to the constitution that would replace the electoral college system with a lot system. The Joint Resolution called for each state to elect, by a simple majority, a presidential candidate of said state. Each state would notify Congress of the presidential election results. Congress would then inscribe the name of every state on uniform balls, equal to the number of said state's members of Congress, and deposit into a box. In a joint session of Congress, a ball would be drawn, and the elected candidate of the state of which is written on the drawn ball would be named president. A second ball would immediately be drawn after, and that state's candidate would be named vice-president. The resolution did not pass the House. Representative Vinton proposed an identical amendment in 1846. Again, it was unsuccessful. The driving force behind the introduction of the resolution is unclear, as there is no recorded debate for either proposal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catalog.archives.gov/id/24200386|title=House Joint Resolution (H.J. Res.) 8 Proposing a Constitutional Amendment to Elect the President by Lot|last=|first=|date=|website=National Archives Catalog|publisher=Center for Legislative Archives, National Archives and Records Administration.|access-date=}}</ref>

Other constitutional amendments, such as the [[Electoral College abolition amendment|Every Vote Counts Amendment]], have been proposed seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, which proponents argue would increase turnout and participation. Other proposed reforms include the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[interstate compact]] without Congressional authorization, whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote, instead of voting their respective statewide results. Another proposal is for every state to simply adopt the District system used by Maine and Nebraska: give two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district. The Automatic Plan would replace the Electors with an automatic tallying of votes to eliminate the faithless elector affecting the outcome of the election. The Proportional Plan, often compared to the District Plan, would distribute electoral votes in each state in proportion to the popular vote, introducing third party effects in election outcomes. The House Plan would require a constitutional amendment to allocate electors based on the House apportionment alone to lessen small state advantage. Direct election plans and bonus plans have in common a higher valuation on the popular vote for president.<ref>Melcher, James P., "[https://www.academia.edu/1536978/Electing_to_Reform_Maine_and_the_District_Plan_for_Selection_of_Presidential_Electors Electing to Reform: Maine and the District Plan for Selection of Presidential Electors]", 2004, New England Political Science Association. viewed October 23, 2014.</ref>

==Voter turnout==
{{see also|Voter turnout in the United States presidential elections}}

[[Voter turnout]] in the 2004 and 2008 elections showed a noticeable increase over the turnout in 1996 and 2000. Prior to 2004, voter turnout in presidential elections had been decreasing while voter registration, measured in terms of voting age population (VAP) by the U.S. Census, has been increasing. The VAP figure, however, includes persons ineligible to vote – mainly non-citizens and ineligible felons – and excludes overseas eligible voters. Opinion is mixed on whether this decline was due to voter apathy<ref name="census.gov">[https://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/voting/013995.html]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/htmlto5.htm|title=National Voter Turnout in Federal Elections: 1960–1996|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|date=2003-07-29|accessdate=2007-12-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209105156/http://www.fec.gov/pages/htmlto5.htm|archivedate=2007-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Election Information: Election Statistics |publisher=[[Office of the Clerk]] |accessdate=2007-12-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070725184700/http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |archivedate=July 25, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/voting.html|publisher=[[U.S. Census Bureau]]|title=Voting and Registration Date|accessdate=2007-12-09}}</ref> or an increase in ineligible voters on the rolls.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/FAQ.html |title=Voter Turnout Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122155234/http://elections.gmu.edu/FAQ.html |archive-date=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
The difference between these two measures are illustrated by analysis of turnout in the 2004 and 2008 elections. Voter turnout from the 2004 and 2008 election was "not statistically different," based on the voting age population used by a November 2008 U.S. Census survey of 50,000 households.<ref name="census.gov"/> If expressed in terms of vote eligible population (VEP), the 2008 national turnout rate was 61.7% from 131.3 million ballots cast for president, an increase of over 1.6 percentage points over the 60.1% turnout rate of 2004, and the highest since 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elections.gmu.edu/preliminary_vote_2008.html |title=2008 Preliminary Voter Turnout |publisher=Elections.gmu.edu |date=March 12, 2009 |accessdate=January 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113104435/http://elections.gmu.edu/preliminary_vote_2008.html |archivedate=November 13, 2008 }}</ref>

==Financial disclosures==
Prior to 1967, many presidential candidates disclosed assets, stock holdings, and other information which might affect the public trust.<ref name=Joseph>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6hNdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MVoNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1118,3648005&dq=george-romney+and+tax-returns&hl=en Income Tax Returns Released for Last 12 Years by Romney], ''St. Joseph Gazette'', United Press International, November 27, 1967.</ref> In that year, Republican candidate [[George W.

==Presidential coattails==
{{main|Coattail effect}}

Presidential elections are held on the same date as those for all the seats in the House of Representatives, the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate, the [[Governor (United States)|governorships]] of several states, and many state and local elections. Presidential candidates tend to bring out supporters who then vote for their party's candidates for those other offices.<ref>"Government By the People; national, state, and local version" Prentice Hall publishers, by Cronin Magleby O'Brien Light</ref> These other candidates are said to ride on the presidential candidates' coattails. Voter turnout is also generally higher during presidential election years than either [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] years<ref>Desilver, D.
