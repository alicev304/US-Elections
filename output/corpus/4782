The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (sometimes referred to as the Intelligence Committee or SSCI) is dedicated to overseeing the United States Intelligence Community—the agencies and bureaus of the federal government of the United States who provide information and analysis for leaders of the executive and legislative branches. The Committee was established in 1976 by the 94th Congress.[1] The Committee is "select" in that membership is temporary and rotated among members of the chamber.[2] The committee comprises 15 members. Eight of those seats are reserved for one majority and one minority member of each of the following committees: Appropriations, Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Judiciary.[3] Of the remaining seven, four are members of the majority, and three are members of the minority.[3] In addition, the Majority Leader and Minority Leader are non-voting ex officio members of the committee.[3] Also, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services (if not already a member of the select Committee) are ex officio members.[4] As part of its oversight responsibilities, the Committee performs an annual review of the intelligence budget submitted by the president and prepares legislation authorizing appropriations for the various civilian and military agencies and departments comprising the intelligence community. These entities include the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, as well as the intelligence-related components of Department of State, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of the Treasury, and Department of Energy. The Committee makes recommendations to the Senate Armed Services Committee on authorizations for the intelligence-related components of the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Marine Corps. The Committee also conducts periodic investigations, audits, and inspections of intelligence activities and programs.

Senator Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii) became the first chairman of the committee when it was established until 1979.[5] Former Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet was staff director of the committee when David Boren of Oklahoma was its chairman. The committee was the center of much controversy and contention during the run-up to the war in Iraq in 2002 and 2003, when chairmanship of the committee changed hands following the November 2002 election. Among the committee staff members at that time were: Pete Dorn, Professional Staff Member;[clarification needed] Jim Hensler, Deputy Staff Director; Vicki Divoll, General Counsel; Steven Cash, Professional Staff Member & Counsel; and Alfred Cumming, Minority Staff Director. On July 9, 2004, the committee issued the Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence Assessments on Iraq, and on June 5, 2008, it issued a long-delayed portion of its "phase two" investigative report, which compared the prewar public statements made by top Bush administration officials to justify the invasion with the intelligence information that was available to them at that time.[6] In a March 6, 2008, letter to the Senate leadership, 14 of the 15 then members of the Committee proposed the creation of a new Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Intelligence to prepare the annual intelligence budget.[7] The proposed Subcommittee, on which members of the Intelligence Committee would be heavily represented, would increase the Committee's influence and leverage over executive branch intelligence agencies, and require continuing disclosure of the annual budget for the National Intelligence Program. The proposal has been opposed by the leadership of the Senate Appropriations Committee, however.[8] In 2013, and beyond, the SSCI received renewed attention in the wake of Edward Snowden's disclosures regarding the NSA surveillance of communications. Senator Dianne Feinstein and the SSCI made several statements on the matter, one of which was notably disputed: that the NSA tracked US citizens locations via cellphone. Later, the SSCI Staff Director, David Grannis, claimed that the NSA did not collect cellphone location, claiming the Senator was "speaking extemporaneously".[9] The SSCI later came to prominence in relation to voting to publish in March 2014[10] and then publishing in December 2014 of a report on the policies of the CIA on torture. In 2017, the SSCI began investigating Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, possible incriminating links between members of the Russian government and Donald Trump's presidential campaign, and the security of election processes in the United States.[11] On April 21, 2020, the SSCI (chaired at the time by the Republican Richard Burr) released a widely-redacted report[12][13][14] with its final judgment that the intelligence community's assessment was "coherent and well-constructed"; the SSCI therefore supports the intelligence community's claim that Putin's "interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election" in favor of candidate Trump was unprecedented in its "manner and aggressiveness."[15][16] Members, 116th Congress[edit] Majority Minority Richard Burr, North Carolina, Chairman Jim Risch, Idaho Marco Rubio, Florida Susan Collins, Maine Roy Blunt, Missouri Tom Cotton, Arkansas John Cornyn, Texas Ben Sasse, Nebraska Mark Warner, Virginia, Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein, California Ron Wyden, Oregon Martin Heinrich, New Mexico Angus King, Maine[17] Kamala Harris, California Michael Bennet, Colorado Ex officio Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Jack Reed, Rhode Island Chuck Schumer, New York Source: Member list[18] Members, 115th Congress[edit] Majority Minority Richard Burr, North Carolina, Chairman Jim Risch, Idaho Marco Rubio, Florida Susan Collins, Maine Roy Blunt, Missouri James Lankford, Oklahoma Tom Cotton, Arkansas John Cornyn, Texas Mark Warner, Virginia, Vice Chairman Dianne Feinstein, California, Ron Wyden, Oregon Martin Heinrich, New Mexico Angus King, Maine[19] Joe Manchin, West Virginia Kamala Harris, California Ex officio Jim Inhofe, Oklahoma Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Jack Reed, Rhode Island Chuck Schumer, New York Source: Member List[20] Chairs[edit] Nº Chair Party State Term 1 Daniel Inouye Democratic Hawaii 1976–1979 2 Birch Bayh Democratic Indiana 1979–1981 3 Barry Goldwater Republican Arizona 1981–1985 4 David Durenberger Republican Minnesota 1985–1987 5 David Boren Democratic Oklahoma 1987–1993 6 Dennis DeConcini Democratic Arizona 1993–1995 7 Arlen Specter Republican Pennsylvania 1995–1997 8 Richard Shelby Republican Alabama 1997–2001 9 Bob Graham Democratic Florida 2001 10 Richard Shelby Republican Alabama 2001 11 Bob Graham Democratic Florida 2001–2003 12 Pat Roberts Republican Kansas 2003–2007 13 Jay Rockefeller Democratic West Virginia 2007–2009 14 Dianne Feinstein Democratic California 2009–2015 15 Richard Burr Republican North Carolina 2015–present Staff directors[edit] Christopher Joyner, 2015–present David Grannis, 2009–2014 Andy Johnson, 2004–2008 Alfred Cumming, 2000–2003 George Tenet, 1989–1993 See also[edit] Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture James R.
