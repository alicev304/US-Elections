Later, Papadopoulos says he declined the offer because he knew it was unethical and possibly illegal, and feared it might have been an FBI setup.[13]:95[45] Page submits an application to the Trump transition team for a position in the new administration.

Kushner asks his executive assistant Catherine Vargas to confirm with Simes that Kislyak is the right person to talk to.

The British government responds, "There is no vacancy."[53][54] Peter W. Smith, who launched a search for copies of Clinton's deleted emails in September, asserts WikiLeaks has had the emails for nine months but has not released them.[55][56] In July 2017, WikiLeaks denies the assertion in response to a question by Politico.[55] Late November: Senior members of Trump's transition team warn Flynn about the dangers of contacting Kislyak, including that Kislyak's conversations are probably being monitored by the FBI and the NSA.

Bannon is invited but does not attend. Kushner tells Kislyak that the new administration wants to start afresh with U.S.-Russia relations. He asks Kislyak who the best person is to hold future discussions with who has direct contact with, and can speak for, Putin. They discuss Syria, and Kislyak suggests that Russian generals brief the transition team over a secure line. Flynn says the transition team doesn't have one, and Kushner asks if they can use the secure facilities in the Russian Embassy. Kislyak rejects the idea.[13]:160–161 In May 2017, the meeting is made public by an anonymous letter to the Washington Post that cites leaked intercepts of Russian diplomatic communications.[63][64] Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zakharova asserts at a press briefing that the Ukrainian government deliberately undermined the Trump campaign during the summer of 2016 by fabricating evidence of Manafort's involvement in Ukrainian corruption.[65][66] December 2016[edit] December: Concerned that the incoming Trump administration will suppress the information collected in the Russia investigation, the White House spreads it across government agencies to leave a trail for future investigators.[67] At an "all-hands" oligarch meeting, Putin tasks Alfa-Bank head Petr Aven with establishing a private communications channel with the Trump transition team. Aven assigns the task to Richard Burt, whose primary role at Alfa-Bank is to facilitate introductions to business contacts in the U.S. and other Western countries. Burt reaches out to Simes, whom he knows through his work as a boardmember of CNI. Simes declines to assist in setting up a secret communications channel because of media attention on Russian interference in the election and didn't want CNI to be seen as the intermediary.[13]:163–165 Early December: In Russia, FSB cyber chief Sergei Mikhailov, senior Kaspersky Lab researcher Ruslan Stoyanov, and hacker Dmitry Dokuchayev (known as "Forb") are arrested for treason.[68][69] December 8 The IRA runs an ad on Craigslist to hire someone to walk around New York City dressed as Santa Claus while wearing a Trump mask.[70][13]:32 Kilimnik sends Manafort a detailed email about the proposed Ukrainian peace plan. He writes that the plan is ready to move forward if Trump appoints Manafort as a "special representative" to manage it, that "[Yanukovych] guarantees your reception at the very top level" in Russia, and that "[Trump] could have peace in Ukraine basically within a few months after inauguration."[13]:142–143 Page is in Moscow. Kilimnik emails Manafort to inform him of Page's presence, and that Page is telling people he is "authorized to talk to Russia on behalf of [Trump] on a range of issues of mutual interest, including Ukraine."[13]:166 December 9: Republican Senator John McCain delivers the Steele dossier to Comey.[71] The Trump transition team dismisses reported intelligence assessments finding Russian interference in the election. Their statement says, "These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.'"[72] Page dines with Shlomo Weber and Andrej Krickovic of the New Economic School in Moscow. They are briefly joined by Arkady Dvorkovich at Krickovic's invitation. Dvorkovich asks Page to facilitate connecting him with individuals on the transition team to begin discussing future cooperation. He also discusses forming a future academic partnership with Page.[13]:166–167 December 10: Glenn R. Simpson tells Ohr that Cohen was the "go-between from Russia to the Trump campaign", and gives him a memory stick containing evidence. Ohr memorializes the meeting in handwritten notes.[73] December 11: Trump tells Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday that intelligence reports of Russian interference are "ridiculous". He says, "It could be somebody sitting in a bed some place." He claims the Democrats are pushing the story because they lost the election.[15]:21–22 December 12: Kislyak meets with Kushner's assistant, Avi Berkowitz, to arrange a meeting between Kushner and the FSB-connected Sergey Gorkov, head of sanctioned Russian bank Vnesheconombank.[74][75][76][77] He says Gorkov has a direct line to Putin.[13]:161 December 13: UBS investment banker Bob Foresman meets with Gorkov and VEB deputy chairman Nikolay Tsekhomsky in Moscow just before Gorkov leaves for New York City to meet with Kushner. They tell Foresman that they are traveling to New York to discuss election issues with U.S. financial institutions on a trip approved by Putin, and will be reporting back to Putin when they return.[13]:162 Gorkov arrives from Moscow to secretly meet Kushner in at the Colony Capital building in New York,[13]:161 before flying to Japan, where Putin is holding a summit. The meeting is first reported in March 2017, and attracts the interest of federal and congressional investigators in May. Kushner later characterizes the meeting as brief and meaningless. The White House later describes the meeting as a diplomatic encounter. The bank later says they discussed Kushner's real estate business.[74][76][78] The Mueller investigation is unable to resolve the conflicting accounts[clarification needed].[13]:163 Trump picks Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State; Russian officials praise the decision.[79] December 14: Dmitriev reaches out via text messages to Kushner's close friend and hedge fund manager Rick Gerson to help arrange meetings with the Trump transition team to help improve economic cooperation with Russia. Nader had introduced Dmitiev to Gerson in early December. Gerson responds that confidentiality is required before the new administration takes power. He says he will reach out to Kushner and Flynn to find out who the "key person or people" are that Dmitriev should meet with. Dmitriev tells Gerson he was tasked by Putin to develop and execute a reconciliation plan between the U.S. and Russia. In June 2018, Gerson tells Mueller's team that he engaged with Dmitriev as a private citizen and not on behalf of the transition team.[13]:157 December 15: Clinton tells a group of donors in Manhattan that Russian hacking was ordered by Putin "because he has a personal beef against me" due to her accusation in 2011 that Russian parliamentary elections that year were rigged.[80][81] Clinton's comment is backed by U.S. Intelligence reports.[82] Kushner, Gerson, Nader, Flynn, Bannon, U.A.E. ambassador to the U.S. Yousef Al Otaiba, crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, and former British prime minister Tony Blair meet at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City. The crown prince broke diplomatic protocol by traveling to the U.S. without announcing his visit to the U.S. government. In June 2018, a spokesman for Gerson tells NBC News that Blair gave a presentation on Israeli-Palestinian peace.[83][84][85][86] December 16: Speaking at his final press conference as president, Obama comes just short of saying Putin was personally behind the DNC and Podesta hacks.[87] December 18: Speaking to CBS News, Conway says it is "false" and "dangerous" to suggest that members of the Trump campaign spoke to any Russians during the campaign.[30][88] Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Priebus declines to state whether Trump accepts the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference. He denies any contact or coordination between the Russians and the campaign and calls the "whole thing" a Democratic "spin job".[15]:22 December 19: Gorkov's assistant Ivanchenko texts Berkowitz, "Hi, please inform your side that the information about the meeting had a very positive response!"[13]:163 December 22: At Kushner's direction,[13]:167–168 Flynn asks Kislyak to delay or defeat a pending vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution calling on Israel to cease settlement activities in Palestinian territory. Flynn later pleads guilty to lying to the FBI about the effort to defeat the resolution.[89][90] Burt informs Aven of Sime's decision not to assist with a secret communications channel to the transition team because of the current political climate in the U.S. regarding Russia. Aven tells Burt to drop the project.[13]:164–165 December 23: Kislyak calls Flynn and tells him Russia will not vote against the United Nations Security Council resolution they spoke about the day before.[90] The resolution passes 14–0, with the U.S. abstaining.[13]:168 December 26: Oleg Erovinkin, a former KGB official, is found dead in the back seat of his car in Moscow. He was suspected of assisting Steele in compiling his dossier.[91] December 28: Kislyak texts Flynn and asks him to call, setting off the series of calls in the following days.[92] Flynn, who is on vacation in the Dominican Republic, does not immediately respond.[13]:169 December 29: The Russian Embassy calls Flynn in the morning, but they do not talk.[13]:169 Following Executive Order 13757 signed the previous day, Obama's administration expels 35 Russian diplomats, locks down two Russian diplomatic compounds, and expands sanctions against Russia.[93][94][95][96] Flynn consults with the Trump transition team,[97][98] then speaks with Kislyak by telephone to request that Russia not escalate matters in response to Obama's actions.[99][100] Flynn later pleads guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak regarding the new sanctions.[90] In December 2017, McFarland tells Mueller's team that Flynn said that Russia will not escalate in response to the sanctions because they want a good relationship with the new administration.[13]:171 Before Flynn's call to Kislyak, K. T. McFarland emails other Trump transition officials saying that Flynn will be speaking to Kislyak to try to prevent a cycle of retaliation over the newly imposed sanctions. The email is forwarded to Flynn, Reince Priebus, Bannon, and Sean Spicer.[101] Trump, Bannon, Spicer, Priebus, and other transition team members are briefed about the new sanctions, and the upcoming Flynn-Kislyak call is discussed.[13]:171 In December 2017, McFarland tells Mueller's team that Trump wanted to use the sanctions as leverage against Russia.[13]:171 The NCCIC releases a joint analysis report titled "GRIZZLY STEPPE – Russian Malicious Cyber Activity" as a follow-up to the October 7, 2016, joint statement on election security. The report describes methods used by Russian intelligence groups APT29 and APT28 to penetrate election-related servers.[102] December 30: Putin announces he will not retaliate against the U.S. expulsions, contrary to recommendations from Lavrov.[103][104][13]:172 In reply, Trump tweets "Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart!"[105][13]:172 This action is widely interpreted as praising Putin's actions.[citation needed] Flyn texts a summary of his Kislyak call to McFarland, who forwards the information by email to Kushner, Bannon, Priebus, and other transition team members. The text and email deliberately omit the sanctions discussion because Flynn doesn't want it documented due to its political sensitivity.[13]:172 December 31: Kislyak calls Flynn to tell him that Russia has decided not to retaliate based upon Flynn's request. Afterward, Flynn tells senior members of the transition team, including Bannon, about his conversations with Kislyak and Russia's decision not to escalate.[90][13]:172 January 2017[edit] Further information: Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (January–June 2017) January: McGahn researches the Logan Act and federal laws related to lying to federal investigators. Records turned over to the Mueller investigation show McGahn believes Flynn violated one or more of those laws.[106] The FBI obtains a new FISA warrant for Carter Page, replacing the expired warrant from October 2016.[107]:163–164 Early January: At a meeting in CIA headquarters, a U.S. spy chief warns Mossad agents that Putin may have "leverages of pressure" over Trump, and that intelligence should be shared cautiously with the coming White House and National Security Council, for fear of leaks to the Russians and thereby Iran.[108][109][110] For two days in early January 2017, in a gathering George Nader attends and brokers, Joel Zamel and General Ahmed Al-Assiri meet with Michael Flynn and other members of the Trump transition team in New York. Bannon was also involved. In October 2018, the meeting comes under the Mueller investigation's scrutiny.[111] January 3: Nader meets with Prince at The Pierre Hotel in New York City and encourages him to meet with Dmitriev. In the following days, Nader gives Prince biographical information about Dmitriev, including the fact that Dmitriev oversees the Russian Direct Investment Fund.[112][13]:151 January 4: The FBI begins investigating Flynn's December phone calls with Kislyak.[113] January 5: Susan Rice's email to herself on January 20, 2017. U.S. intelligence agencies release a report concluding that Putin ordered the cyber-campaign to influence the 2016 election.[34][114] Obama is briefed on the intelligence community's findings.[115] Flynn, Kushner and Bannon meet with the King of Jordan. According to BuzzFeed, they discuss a plan to deploy American nuclear power plants in Jordan with security support from a Russian company. "People close to the three Trump advisers" deny the allegations.[116][117] R. James Woolsey Jr., who became a senior adviser to Trump in September 2016, resigns amid Congressional hearings into cyber attacks and public statements by Trump critical of the United States Intelligence Community.[118] January 6: The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) publishes an unclassified report[119] about Russian meddling in the 2016 election stating that "Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election".[120] While the report says Russian hackers did not change votes, it ignores the security of back-end election systems.[121] Putin was personally involved in the Russian interference, per a CIA stream of intelligence.[82] Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, NSA Director Michael Rogers, and FBI Director James Comey travel to Trump Tower in New York City to brief Trump and senior members of the transition team on the classified version of the ODNI report on Russian interference in the election.[122][123][124] They show Trump the intelligence behind their assessment, including human sources confirming Putin's role, and American, British, and Dutch intelligence services seeing stolen DNC documents in Russian military networks.[125] In addition to Trump, the other people present are incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, incoming CIA Director Mike Pompeo, incoming National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and Vice President-elect Mike Pence. After the briefing, Comey stays behind to privately brief Trump on the salacious allegations in the Steele dossier. While cordial during the briefings, Trump still refuses to accept the intelligence on Russian interference.[82] The meeting unsettles Comey and prompts him to write a memo documenting the conversation.[126] Trump is briefed on highly classified intelligence — including from a top-secret source close to Putin — indicating that Putin had personally ordered cyberattacks to influence the 2016 American election.[127] Vekselberg's cousin and Columbus Nova CEO Andrew Intrater donates $250,000 to the Trump inaugural fund. Intrater's previous political donations totaled less than $3,000 across all candidates.[128] January 7: Prince books his trip to the Seychelles.[13]:152 January 8: Bloomberg reports that Ted Malloch was interviewed by the Trump transition team for the position of U.S. Ambassador to the European Union. Malloch was recommended for the position by Nigel Farage.[129] In 2018, Malloch is served a search warrant by the FBI and questioned by Mueller.[130][131] Nader informs Dmitriev that Prince will be traveling to the Seychelles and invites Dmitriev to meet with Prince on January 12. The next day, Nader assures Dmitriev that Prince wields enough influence in the Trump team to be worth meeting and was designated by Bannon for the trip. In 2018 Nader tells Mueller's team that Prince led him to believe that Bannon was aware of the Dmitriev meeting, and, separately, Prince tells them it was fair for Nader to think he was representing the transition team, but Bannon tells them that Prince didn't inform him of the meeting in advance.[13]:152–153 January 9: Cohen and Vekselberg meet at Trump Tower to discuss their mutual desire to improve Russia's relationship with the U.S. under the Trump administration.[132] After President Trump is inaugurated, Cohen receives a $1 million consulting contract from Columbus Nova, headed by Andrew Intrater, who also attended the Vekselberg meeting.[133] Kushner is named Senior Advisor to the President.[134] Profexer, a Ukrainian hacker who is the author of a hacking tool described in the December 29, 2016, NCCIC report on Russian cyber attacks, goes dark. He turns himself in to the Ukrainian police and becomes a cooperating witness for the FBI. The Ukrainian police say he was not placed under arrest.[135] Dmitriev sends his biography to Gerson and asks him to "share it with Jared (or somebody else very senior in the team) - so that they know that we are focused from our side on improving the relationship and my boss asked me to play a key role in that." He also asks if Prince is important or worth spending time with.[13]:158 January 10: In a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sessions denies communicating with the Russian government during Trump's election campaign.[136] BuzzFeed publishes the Steele dossier alleging various misdeeds by Trump and associates in Russia.[137] Trump dismisses the dossier as "fake news".[138] January 11: Trump tweets, "Russia has never tried to use leverage over me. I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA – NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!".[139] USA Today says this is "not exactly true".[140] Trump holds a press conference in which he calls the Steele dossier a disgrace and denies having any dealings with Russia.[15]:23 BBC News's Paul Wood writes that the salacious information in Steele's dossier was also reported by "multiple intelligence sources" and "at least one East European intelligence service".[141][142] Erik Prince, a Trump campaign donor and brother of forthcoming Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, meets in the Seychelles with Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian government's $10bn Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).[143][144][13]:153–155 They meet in Nader's room for 30–45 minutes, then have a brief meeting at a restaurant on the Four Seasons Hotel property.[13]:153–154 After the second meeting, Dmitriev tells Nader he is disappointed that Prince didn't have more authority in the Trump team, and that he found Prince's comments to be insulting.[13]:155 Prince will claim in August that he scarcely remembers Dmitriev.[143][144] Dmitriev's identity is revealed in November 2017, and Prince confirms the meeting in an interview with House investigators on November 30.[143][144] The meeting was organized by the U.A.E. and reportedly includes talks of a "back channel" with Moscow to try to influence Russian policy in the Middle East, joint U.S.–Russian military operations in Syria, peace between Ukraine and Russia, nuclear non-proliferation, RDIF investment in the midwest, and a joint investment fund between RDIF and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.[86][145][146][147] George Nader, an adviser to crown prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the U.A.E., facilitates and attends.[148][112] In May 2018 Dmitriev suggests the meeting was more than a chance encounter.[149] The meeting occurs amid a series of meetings of politically connected individuals from Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa that are part of a larger gathering hosted by the crown prince.[150] Michael Cohen tells Sean Hannity on The Sean Hannity Show that there is no relationship between Russia and the people around Trump or the Trump campaign.[151][152] Politico publishes a report on its investigation into the involvement of some Ukrainian government officials in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including helping Alexandra Chalupa with her research and revealing Manafort's name in the Party of Region's "black ledger". The report concludes that the Ukrainian government is too fragmented and factionalized to perform an interference campaign of the scale attributed to Russian interference.[153] Trump asks Clapper, Comey, and other intelligence community leaders to publicly refute the Steele dossier allegations.[15]:28 January 12: "Guccifer 2.0" denies having any relation to the Russian government.[154][155] Deripaska's longtime American lobbyist Adam Waldman makes the first of nine visits with Assange in 2017 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.[156] Manafort returns to the U.S. after meeting with Deripaska deputy Georgiy Oganov in Madrid, where they discussed global politics and "recreating [the] old friendship" between Manafort and Deripaska.[13]:142 Prince contacts Bannon's personal assistant Alexandra Preate[157] to setup a meeting with Bannon to discuss the Seychelles trip.[13]:155 The Washington Post reveals Flynn's phone calls with Kislyak.[158] Priebus tells Flynn the "boss" wants the story killed.[15]:29 Flynn has McFarland tell the Post that there were no discussions of sanctions in the calls.[15]:29 The Post updates the story to add a denial by a "Trump official."[15]:29[158] January 13: President-elect Trump nominates U.S. Attorney Rod J. Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General.[159] Sean Spicer claims in a press conference that Flynn had only one call with Kislyak, about setting up a call between Trump and Putin.[160] Emails from December show Spicer most likely knew Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak on December 29, 2016, and may have known about the purpose of the call in advance.[101] Waldman visits Assange for the second time.[156] K.T. McFarland insists to a reporter at The Washington Post that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss sanctions and only spoke with each other prior to December 29. The statement contradicts emails between herself and Flynn.[161] The Senate Intelligence Committee announces it will investigate Russian cyberattacks, meddling in the election, and "intelligence regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns."[162][163][164] January 15: Interviewed on CBS's Face the Nation[165] and Fox News Sunday, Vice President-elect Pence repeatedly denies any connection between the Trump campaign team and Russians.[52] He also denies Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak.[160] Priebus makes similar claims on Meet The Press, and also alleges the DNC colluded with Ukraine to interfere in the 2016 elecion.[166][167][15]:30 Manafort emails McFarland, copying Flynn, about "some important information I want to share that I picked up on my travels over the last month." Flynn advises McFarland not to respond. In 2018, Manafort tells Mueller's team that he was referring to Cuba, which he had visited along with other countries at the time, and not Russia or Ukraine.[13]:142 Prince again contacts Preate to arrange a meeting with Bannon about the Seychelles trip.[13]:155 January 16: Anthony Scaramucci, then a member of the Trump transition team, meets Dmitriev at the World Economic Forum in Davos. They discuss possible joint investments with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is under U.S. sanctions.[145][168][169] Dmitriev sends Gerson a two-page document consolidating the U.S.-Russia reconciliation ideas they had discussed.[13]:158 Mid January: Prince meets with Bannon to brief him on Dmitriev and their meetings in the Seychelles. In 2018, Prince tells Mueller's team that Bannon seemed disinterested. Later in 2018, Bannon tells Mueller's team that he didn't remember discussing Dmitriev with Prince, and that he would have dissapproved of the Seychelles meeting if he had known about it. Mueller's team is unable to resolve the conflicting accounts beyond the text messages Prince sent to Preate, and neither Bannon nor Prince can explain why they did not retain any text messages prior to March 2017 even though they texted frequently according to phone records.[13]:156 January 17: Sessions states in writing that he has not been "in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election."[170] Sessions had been accused of failing to disclose two meetings with Kislyak.[171] Leonard Blavatnik, Sergei Kislyak, and Russian-American president of IMG Artists Alexander Shustorovich attend the Chairman's Global Dinner, an invitation-only inaugural event. Other attendees include Michael Flynn, Manafort, Bannon, and Nix. Blavatnik and Shustorovich donated $1 million each to the Trump inaugural fund. Shustorovich is a longtime business partner of Vekselberg, and, nearly 20 years earlier, the Republican National Committee returned his six-figure donation because of his past ties to the Russian government.[172][173][128] January 17–20: Dmitriev circulates a memo at the World Economic Forum in Davos that describes his discussions with Prince in the Seychelles on January 11.[147] January 18: Jared Kushner files his security clearance application without listing his meetings with Russians.[174] The Daily Sabah reports a breakfast event occurred at the Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C., with about 60 invitees, including Nunes, Flynn, and foreign officials.[175] The Daily Beast reports in January 2019 Mueller is investigating whether foreigners contributed money to the Trump inaugural fund and PAC through American intermediaries.[176] Dmitriev tells Gerson that Bannon asked Prince to meet with him and they had a positive meeting.[13]:158 Gerson gives Dmitriev's reconciliation document to Kushner and explains who Dmitriev is. Kushner passes the document on to Bannon and Tillerson. In April 2018, Kushner tells Mueller's team that they never followed up on the document.[13]:158 January 18/19: McClatchy[177] and The New York Times report that Manafort, Page and Stone have been under investigation by the FBI, NSA, CIA, and FinCEN,[178] based on intercepted Russian communications and financial transactions.[179] Sources say "the investigators have accelerated their efforts in recent weeks but have found no conclusive evidence of wrongdoing."[178] January 19: Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ben Cardin send Treasury Secretary-Designate Steve Mnuchin a letter asking him to commit to investigating Scaramucci for possibly violating U.S. sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund during his January 16 meeting with Dmitriev in Davos.[145][168][180] On May 12, in response to a follow-up query, the Treasury Department informs Warren her letter was forwarded to the Office of Foreign Assets Control.[145][181] Vekselberg and Intrater meet Cohen for a second time at the Candlelight Dinner, an event for $1 million donors to Trump's inaugural fund. They are seated together with Cohen's family. Days later, Columbus Nova awards Cohen a $1 million consulting contract.[182][172] Billionaire Leonard Blavatnik and Kazakh oligarch Alexander Mashkevitch attend the Candlelight Dinner. They qualified for tickets to the event by donating $1 million each to the Trump inaugural fund.[172] In December 2018, it is reported at least 16 Trump associates interacted with Russian nationals during the campaign and post-election transition, including Papadopoulos, Manafort, Gates, Flynn, Page, Sessions, Gordon, Caputo, Sater, Cohen, Prince, Stone, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr., Kushner, and Kushner aide Avi Berkowitz.[183][184] Dmitriev gives his reconciliation document to Nader. He tells Nader, "[it is] a view from our side that I discussed in my meeting on the [Seychelles] islands and with you and with our friends. Please share with them - we believe this is a good foundation to start from."[13]:158 January 20: Obama leaves office.[185] See Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump.
