Oregon voters have the option of not voting for any of the candidates for office who are printed on the ballot, but instead writing in a name of a candidate for each office. All write-in votes for each office on the ballot are tallied together with a lump sum recorded unless: 1 No names of candidates are printed on the ballot for the office; or 2 If the total number of write-in votes for candidates equals or exceeds the total number of votes for any candidate for the same nomination or office. In these two circumstances, the county clerk tallies all write-in votes cast for the office to show the total number of votes for each write-in candidate. ^ "Fighting to get on the presidential ballot in Texas".
