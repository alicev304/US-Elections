She swept the state on election day, winning the primary by 29 points, a clear difference from 2008 when she lost Maryland to Barack Obama. According to exit polls, 43 percent of voters in the Maryland Democratic Primary were Caucasian and they opted for Clinton by a margin of 52-42 compared to the 46 percent of African American voters who backed Clinton by a margin of 75-22. Clinton swept all socioeconomic/income classes and educational attainment categories in Maryland as well. She won the votes of people over the age of 45, 75-20, but lost the youth vote to Sanders 52-46. She won both men (55-40) and women (68-29). In terms of party identification, of the 80 percent of self-identified Democrats who voted in the primary, 69 percent backed Clinton while 30 percent supported Bernie Sanders; Independents, who made up 17 percent of the voters, backed Sanders by a 51-39 margin. Clinton also won all ideological groups. Clinton performed well in the urban and suburban parts of the state in and around Baltimore (which she won 63-34), and the Washington, D.C. suburbs (which she won 71-27), and she also won in the more rural parts of the state like the Eastern Shore (which she won 57-37) and Western Maryland (which she won 53-47), which includes parts of Appalachia.[14] References[edit] ^ Maryland State Board of Elections - Official Primary Results ^ "Maryland poll April 21-24, 2016".
