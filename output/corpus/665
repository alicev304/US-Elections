In 1892 Sewall launched the Roanoke, which at the time was the world's largest wooden ship.[4] Following the death of his father he and his brother lead their successful and wealthy shipbuilding business and following his brother's death in 1879 he took complete control. He served as President of the Maine Central railroad from 1884 to 1893 and also served as President of the Bath National Bank. In June 1895 he came out in support of free silver and at the 1896 Democratic National Convention he took third place on the first ballot behind Representative Joseph C. Sibley and Publisher John R. McLean and after initially losing delegates on the second ballot rebounded and took the majority on the fifth ballot before behind nominated by acclamation.[5] His selection is believed to have been an effort to win votes among conservative and New England members of the party who were disturbed by the populist aspects of William Jennings Bryan. Arthur Sewall is also one of the few politicians to be an adherent of Swedenborgianism, a religion based on the writings of Swedish theologian Emanuel Swedenborg.[6] His main vice-presidential opponent, Garret A. Hobart (Rep), was also an Eastern banker and industrialist who had served on his party's national committee. Sewall was Bryan's running mate for the first of Bryan's three times as the Democratic presidential nominee. On September 5, 1900 Sewall died in Small Point, Maine from apoplexy and at the time of his death he was worth $5,000,000 ($152,282,302 with inflation).[7] Legacy[edit] Sewall's grandson, Sumner Sewall, served as Governor of Maine from 1941 to 1945, as a Republican. In 2008, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch referenced Sewall in an article criticizing Senator John McCain's selection of Gov. Sarah Palin as his vice presidential candidate in the 2008 presidential election, saying he had picked "the least qualified running mate since the Swedenborgian shipbuilder Arthur Sewall ran as William Jennings Bryan's No. 2 in 1896."[8] References[edit] ^ The First Battle: A Story of the Campaign of 1896 By William Jennings Bryan see Chapter 12, page 221 ^ Steel Glory: The Life of Shipbuilder Arthur Sewall (1835-1900) by Susie Yakowicz ^ Steel Glory: The Life of Shipbuilder Arthur Sewall (1835-1900) by Susie Yakowicz ^ "Death Of Arthur Sewall".
