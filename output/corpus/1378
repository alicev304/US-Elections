pcr test work start throat swab sputum sample patient amplify specimen machine look unique coronavirus genetic material actually happen coronavirus test first health care worker take swab sputum sample back patient throat nose generally use long thin nasopharyngeal swab swab store sterile tube vial send lab access test kit train lab technician extract genetic information specimen purify genetic material mix material include derive coronavirus know reagent entire solution place testing machine size toaster patient specimen contain coronavirus viruss genetic material will amplify machine will positive result specimen coronavirus will negative result whole process generally measure day though time get result shorter hospital clinic test kit inhouse test important pcr test widespread accurate diagnostic test determine whether someone currently infect coronavirus united states nearly 1 million people test positive coronavirus use pcr test health official consistently say testing need understand virus spread stop people test positive virus quarantine isolate keep spread particularly important covid19 infected people symptom without positive test even know spread virus holdup first centers disease control preventions initial rollout pcr test fraught problem delay uss early response issue since fix lead delay testing early now primary holdup simply one supply demand pcr test require specialize supplies expensive instrument expertise trained lab technician sudden mass demand test correspond issue supply chain shortage almost every step process include swab reagent want thing say dr april abbott director microbiology deaconess health system indiana just manage extreme struggle abbott say time go easier hospital system get swab reagent overall though pcr test require expertise specialize supplies way make difficult ramp production immediately especially federal government push responsibility onto individual state come large logistical problem say dr donald

coronavirus antibody drive testing site hempstead ny tuesday april 14 2020 antibody test also know serology test detect virus instead detect whether someone antibody immune system fight novel coronavirus people develop antibody body fight virus work antibody test mean coronavirus pandemic antibody test perform blood specimen finger prick take vein majority antibody test require train expert examine blood specimen antibody specifically target coronavirus bloodstream library antibody various viral bacterial fungal infection weve lifetime say cnn medical analyst dr kent sepkowitz infectious disease specialist goal test find antibody specifically apply novel coronavirus cause covid19 however seven different coronavirus cause illness human include several cause mild symptom like common cold antibody coronavirus appear similar decipher common cold antibody covid19 antibody real challenge scientifically sepkowitz say test important antibody test generally use diagnosis give sense widely virus spread population give pcr testing short supply early week coronavirus outbreak wider antibody testing help know many people recover coronavirus possibly without even know infected addition expert believe people recover virus will sort protection reinfection antibody testing use decide immune virus may able work without fear infection however virus still new unclear strong immunity might long might last expect people infect covid19 will develop antibody response will provide level protection world health organization write series tweet saturday yet know level protection long will last work scientist around world better understand body response covid19 infection far study answer important question holdup primary issue antibody testing question accuracy yet clear test consistently correct march food drug administration issue policy allow developer antibody test go market without prior fda review meet certain condition fda also authorize eight antibody test emergency use authorization mean fda validate accuracy test lead glut unreliable test uncertainty among health official task get rigorous level study just happen majority antibody test available abbott say inaccurate result also deadly consequence false positive antibody test lead someone think immune virus dangerous result really want purchase something may give inaccurate information abbott say worse give result inaccurate want make sure confident result give antigen test ideally coronavirus antigen test similar athome pregnancy test expert say antigen test quick easy way look specific antigen term foreign substance like virus bacterium antigen test flu strep throat example doctor office without expensive equipment give result minute yet reliable antigen test novel coronavirus theoretically possible company work make one work think athome pregnancy test coronavirus antigen test put bodily sample throat swab onto specially treat strip use color marker say whether novel coronavirus present antigen test coronavirus breakthrough top white house official say need antigen test work look unique part novel coronavirus specific protein one namesake corona spike specific protein present detectable quantity test positive result test important antigen testing provide immediate answer whether someone infect coronavirus theory mass produce home use likely replace pcr test reliable good first step say potentially use triage test rapidly identify patient likely covid19 reduce eliminate need expensive molecular confirmatory testing dr deborah birx white house coronavirus response coordinator say us will need breakthrough antigen test increase testing sufficient level will never ability nucleic acid test 300 million test day test everybody go work school birx say
