Traditionally, the primary elections are [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The general election in November is <!-- R: put Trump first, he received more electoral votes (in the first column) -->also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors in turn directly elect the president and vice president.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/provisions|title=Legal Provisions Relevant to the Electoral College Process|date=September 5, 2019|website=National Archives|language=en|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref>

== Primary process ==

The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] took place between February and June 2016, staggered among the 50 states, the [[District of Columbia]], and [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]. This nominating process was also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots for a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who in turn elected their party's presidential nominee.

Speculation about the 2016 campaign began almost immediately following the 2012 campaign, with ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine declaring that the race had begun in an article published on November 8, two days after the 2012 election.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Amira |first1=Dan |title=Let the 2016 Campaign Season Begin! |url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2012/11/let-the-2016-campaign-season-begin.html |accessdate=July 5, 2015 |location=New York |date=November 8, 2012}}</ref> On the same day, ''[[Politico]]'' released an article predicting that the 2016 general election would be between Clinton and former [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Jeb Bush]], while a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article named [[List of Governors of New Jersey|New Jersey Governor]] [[Chris Christie]] and Senator [[Cory Booker]] from [[New Jersey]] as potential candidates.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Johnathon |last2=Haberman |first2=Maggie |title=Back to the future: Clinton vs. Bush? |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/11/back-to-the-future-clinton-vs-bush-083550 |accessdate=March 22, 2017 |publisher=Politico |date=November 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Barbaro |first1=Micharl |title=After Obama, Christie Wants a G.O.P.

{{Main|2016 Republican Party presidential primaries}}

With seventeen major candidates entering the race, starting with [[Ted Cruz]] on March 23, 2015, this was the largest presidential primary field for any political party in American history.<ref>{{cite news |title=More People Are Running for Presidential Nomination Than Ever |url=http://time.com/3948922/jim-gilmore-virginia-2016/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date = February 14, 2016 |first=Jack |last=Linshi |date=July 7, 2015}}</ref>

Prior to the [[2016 Iowa Republican caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 1, 2016, Perry, Walker, Jindal, Graham, and Pataki withdrew due to low polling numbers. Despite leading many polls in Iowa, Trump came in second to Cruz, after which Huckabee, Paul, and Santorum withdrew due to poor performances at the ballot box. Following a sizable victory for Trump in the [[New Hampshire Republican primary, 2016|New Hampshire primary]], Christie, Fiorina, and Gilmore abandoned the race. Bush followed suit after scoring fourth place to Trump, Rubio, and Cruz in [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2016|South Carolina]]. On March 1, 2016, the first of four "[[Super Tuesday]]" primaries, Rubio won his first contest in Minnesota, Cruz won Alaska, Oklahoma, and his home of Texas, and Trump won the other seven states that voted. Failing to gain traction, Carson suspended his campaign a few days later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/ben-carson-suspends-2016-campaign-cpac-n532056 |title=Ben Carson Suspends 2016 Campaign at CPAC |publisher=[[NBC News]] |access-date = March 9, 2016 |date=March 4, 2016 |first=Andrew |last=Rafferty}}</ref> On March 15, 2016, the second "Super Tuesday", Kasich won his only contest in his home state of Ohio, and Trump won five primaries including Florida.

Between March 16 and May 3, 2016, only three candidates remained in the race: Trump, Cruz, and Kasich. Cruz won the most delegates in four Western contests and in Wisconsin, keeping a credible path to denying Trump the nomination on the first ballot with 1,237 delegates.

Hillary Clinton focused her candidacy on several themes, including raising middle class incomes, expanding women's rights, instituting campaign finance reform, and improving the [[Affordable Care Act]]. In March 2016, she laid out a detailed economic plan basing her economic philosophy on [[inclusive capitalism]], which proposed a "clawback" that rescinds tax cuts and other benefits for companies that move jobs overseas; with provision of incentives for companies that share profits with employees, communities and the environment, rather than focusing on short-term profits to increase stock value and rewarding shareholders; as well as increasing collective bargaining rights; and placing an "exit tax" on companies that move their headquarters out of the U.S. in order to pay a lower tax rate overseas.<ref name=offersecplan>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/05/us/politics/hillary-clinton-offers-economic-plan-focused-on-jobs.html |title=Clinton Offers Economic Plan Focused on Jobs |first=Amy |last=Chozick |work=The New York Times |date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Clinton promoted equal pay for equal work to address current alleged shortfalls in how much women are paid to do the same jobs men do,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-equal-pay-problem-solving-would-be-top-priorities/ |title=Hillary Clinton: Equal pay, problem-solving would be top priorities |date=February 24, 2015 |work=CBS News}}</ref> promoted explicitly focus on family issues and support of [[universal preschool]],<ref name="AP outset">{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/130dda61f1e24e05ba2233b3e80fa638/clinton-patches-relations-liberals-campaigns-outset |title=Clinton patches relations with liberals at campaign's outset |work=The Big Story |agency=Associated Press |first=Lisa |last=Lerder |date=April 19, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623162718/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/130dda61f1e24e05ba2233b3e80fa638/clinton-patches-relations-liberals-campaigns-outset |archivedate=June 23, 2015}}</ref> expressed support for the right to same-sex marriage,<ref name="AP outset"/> and proposed allowing undocumented immigrants to have a path to citizenship stating that it "{{bracket|i}}s at its heart a family issue".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chozick |first1=Amy |title=A Path to Citizenship, Clinton Says, 'Is at Its Heart a Family Issue' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/05/05/a-path-to-citizenship-clinton-says-is-at-its-heart-a-family-issue/ |work=The New York Times |date=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian intelligence service, the [[GRU (G.U.)|GRU]], hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into "the computer networks of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) and the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC)". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's personas "[[DCLeaks]]" and "[[Guccifer 2.0]]."<ref name="InterceptAnnotate">{{Cite web |last1=Mackey |first1=Robert |last2=Risen |first2=James |last3=Aaronson |first3=Trevor |title=Annotating special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report |url=https://theintercept.com/2019/04/18/annotating-special-counsel-robert-muellers-redacted-report/ |work=[[The Intercept]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="ExaminerRussia">{{Cite web |last1=Dunleavy |first1=Jerry |title=Mueller says Russia's GRU stole Clinton, DNC emails and gave them to WikiLeaks |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mueller-says-russias-gru-stole-clinton-dnc-emails-and-gave-them-to-wikileaks |work=[[Washington Examiner]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref name="MuellerGRUhack">''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas "DCLeaks" and "Guccifer 2.0." The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.</ref>

To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, the special counsel's investigators "applied the framework of [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy law]]", and not the concept of "collusion", because collusion "is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law."<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Morais |first1=Betsy |title=Collusion by any other name |url=https://www.cjr.org/first_person/trump-mueller-collusion.php |date=April 18, 2019 |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |access-date=April 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol.

But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.</ref> They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign "coordinated" with Russia, using the definition of "coordination" as having "an agreement‚Äîtacit or express‚Äîbetween the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference". Investigators further elaborated that merely having "two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests" was not enough to establish coordination.<!-- ref name=NYTcompare/ --><ref>''[https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mueller Report]'', vol. I, p. 2: In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question of whether members of the Trump Campaign "coordinat[ed]"‚Äîa term that appears in the appointment order‚Äîwith Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, "coordination" does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement‚Äîtacit or express‚Äîbetween the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.</ref>

The Mueller Report writes that the investigation "identified numerous links between the Russian government and the Trump campaign", found that Russia "perceived it would benefit from a Trump presidency" and that the 2016 Trump presidential campaign "expected it would benefit electorally" from Russian hacking efforts. Ultimately, "the investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities".<ref name="GlobeGraphic">{{Cite web |last1=Ostriker |first1=Rebecca |last2=Puzzanghera |first2=Jim |last3=Finucane |first3=Martin |last4=Datar |first4=Saurabh |last5=Uraizee |first5=Irfan |last6=Garvin |first6=Patrick |title=What the Mueller report says about Trump and more |url=https://apps.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/graphics/2019/03/mueller-report/ |website=[[The Boston Globe]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref><ref name="TIMErelease">{{cite magazine |last1=Law |first1=Tara |title=Here Are the Biggest Takeaways From the Mueller Report |url=http://time.com/5567077/mueller-report-release/ |magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=April 22, 2019}}</ref>

However, investigators had an incomplete picture of what had really occurred during the 2016 campaign, due to some associates of Trump campaign providing either false, incomplete or declined testimony, as well as having deleted, unsaved or encrypted communications.

The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] (CPD), a non-profit organization, hosted [[United States presidential election debates|debates]] between qualifying presidential and vice-presidential candidates. According to the commission's website, to be eligible to opt to participate in the anticipated debates, "in addition to being Constitutionally eligible, candidates must appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning a majority vote in the Electoral College, and have a level of support of at least 15 percent of the national electorate as determined by five selected national public opinion polling organizations, using the average of those organizations' most recently publicly-reported results at the time of the determination."<ref>[http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview "The Commission on Presidential Debates: An Overview"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926232716/http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=overview |date=September 26, 2016 }}, Debates.org.</ref>

The three locations ([[Hofstra University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]) chosen to host the presidential debates, and the one location ([[Longwood University]]) selected to host the vice presidential debate, were announced on September 23, 2015.

The news media and election experts were surprised twice: first, at Trump's winning the [[wikt:GOP|GOP]] nomination; second, at his winning the electoral college. English political scientist Lloyd Gruber said, "One of the major casualties of the 2016 election season has been the reputation of political science, a discipline whose practitioners had largely dismissed Donald Trump's chances of gaining the Republican nomination."<ref>Lloyd Gruber, "How political scientists got Trump exactly wrong." [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/67227/1/blogs.lse.ac.uk-How%20political%20scientists%20got%20Trump%20exactly%20wrong.pdf ''USApp‚ÄìAmerican Politics and Policy Blog'' (01 Jun 2016)]</ref> The final polls showed a lead by Clinton‚Äîand in the end, she did receive more votes.<ref>Fred Andrew Wright and Alec Aidan Wright, "How Surprising Was Trump's Victory?

According to the authors of ''[[Shattered: Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign]]'', by late Tuesday night the White House had concluded that Trump would win the election. Obama's political director [[David Simas]] called Clinton campaign manager [[Robby Mook]] to persuade Clinton to concede the election, with no success. Obama then called Clinton directly, citing the importance of [[continuity of government]], to ask her to publicly acknowledge that Trump had won.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Allen | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Parnes | first2 = Amie | chapter = "I'm sorry" | chapter-url =https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QqvNDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT409 | title = Shattered: inside Hillary Clinton's doomed campaign | publisher = Crown | location = New York | year = 2017 | isbn = 9780553447095 }}</ref> Believing that Clinton was still unwilling to concede, the president then called her campaign chair [[John Podesta]], but the call to Clinton had likely already persuaded her.<ref name="press20170424">{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljkg-cRGfZo |title=Inside Hillary Clinton's Hotel Room on Election Night 2016 |date=April 24, 2017 |last=Press |first=Bill |publisher=YouTube |others=Peter Ogburn, Amie Parnes, Jonathan Allen |time=1:45}}</ref>

=== The next day ===

On Wednesday morning at 2:30&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time]] (ET), it was reported that Trump had secured Wisconsin's 10 electoral votes, giving him a majority of the 538 electors in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], enough to make him the [[president-elect of the United States]].<ref name="McCarthyPhipps2016">{{cite news |author1 = Ciara McCarthy |author2 = Claire Phipps |title = Election results timeline: how the night unfolded |url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/08/presidential-election-updates-trump-clinton-news |newspaper = [[The Guardian]] |date = November 9, 2016 |accessdate = October 29, 2018}}</ref>

=== Statistical analysis ===

Six states plus a portion of Maine that Obama won in 2012 switched to Trump (Electoral College votes in parentheses): Florida (29), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), Wisconsin (10), Iowa (6), and Maine's second congressional district (1). Initially, Trump won exactly 100 more Electoral College votes than Mitt Romney had in 2012, with two lost to [[faithless electors]] in the final tally. Thirty-nine states swung more Republican compared to the previous presidential election, while eleven states and the District of Columbia swung more Democratic.<ref name="LeipAtlas2016PrezResults"/>

Based on [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates of the [[voting age population]] (VAP), turnout of voters casting a vote for president was nearly 1% higher than in 2012.{{failed verification|date=February 2020}}<ref Name="turnout"/> Examining overall turnout in the [[2016 United States elections|2016 election]], University of Florida Prof. Michael McDonald estimated that 138.8 million Americans cast a ballot.<ref name="US Elections Project">{{cite web |url=http://www.electproject.org/2016g |title=2016 November General Election Turnout Rates |website=United States Elections Project |accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref> 65.9 million of those ballots were counted for Clinton and just under 63 million for Trump, representing 20.3% (Clinton) and 19.4% (Trump) of a census estimate of U.S. population that day of 324 million.<ref name="LeipAtlas2016PrezResults"/><ref>U.S. Census Bureau. (2016). Population clock. Retrieved from https://www.census.gov/popclock/</ref> Considering a VAP of 250.6 million people and voting eligible population (VEP) of 230.6 million people, this is a turnout rate of 55.4% VAP and 60.2% VEP.<ref Name=turnout /><ref name="US Elections Project"/> Based on this estimate, voter turnout was up compared to 2012 (54.1% VAP) but down compared to 2008 (57.4% VAP). A FEC report of the election recorded an official total of 136.7 million votes cast for President‚Äîmore than any prior election.<ref Name="turnout"/>

Data scientist [[Hamdan Azhar]] noted the paradoxes of the 2016 outcome, saying that "chief among them [was] the discrepancy between the popular vote, which Hillary Clinton won by 2.8 million votes, and the electoral college, where Trump won 304-227".<ref name="AzharForbes12292016">{{cite news |last=Azhar |first=Hamdan |date=December 29, 2016 |title=2016 Vs. 2012: How Trump's Win And Clinton's Votes Stack Up To Romney And Obama |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2016/12/29/2016-vs-2012-how-trumps-win-and-clintons-votes-stack-up-to-obama-and-romney |work=Forbes |location=New York City |accessdate=February 4, 2018}}</ref> He said Trump outperformed Mitt Romney's 2012 results, while Clinton only just matched Barack Obama's 2012 totals.<ref name="AzharForbes12292016"/> Hamdan also said Trump was "the highest vote earner of any Republican candidate ever," exceeding [[George W. Bush]]'s 62.04 million votes in 2004, though neither reached Clinton's 65.9 million, nor Obama's 69.5 million votes in 2008, the overall record.<ref name="AzharForbes12292016"/> He concluded, with help from ''The Cook Political Report'', that the election hinged not on Clinton's large 2.8 million overall vote margin over Trump, but rather on about 78,000 votes from only three counties in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.<ref name="AzharForbes12292016"/> CPR also noted that by the same logic, Obama won in 2012 due to three counties in Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://cookpolitical.com/story/10201 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715170550/http://cookpolitical.com/story/10201 |journal=[[The Cook Political Report]] |title=56 Interesting Facts About the 2016 Election |date=December 16, 2016 |archivedate=July 15, 2017}}</ref>

=== Impact of automation ===

A 2017 study done by Economists and Economic Historians [[Carl Benedikt Frey]], Chinchih Chen and Thor Berger examines the link between the adoption of automation and the results of the 2016 election. The study points out that since the 1980s, the advancement of technology has often led to a significant fraction of the workforce being worse off. Low skilled workers affected by [[Technological unemployment|technology driven job displacement]] had to replace their middle-income jobs with lower-income service jobs, or were pushed out of the workforce altogether, while the advancement of technology increased the demand for high-income jobs among skilled workers. Frey and his co-authors note a positive trend between automation driven income inequality and the movement toward [[political polarization]] in the United States. The study found a strong correlation between areas affected by technological automation and the increase of support for Donald Trump among low-skilled workers in the affected voting districts, concluding that:<blockquote>While the Computer Revolution has not rendered the workforce redundant, a large share of Americans have lost the race to technology, which is reflected in the reallocation of millions of workers from middle-income jobs to low-income occupations or non-employment as their jobs have been automated away{{nbsp}}... the victims of the Computer Revolution have a higher propensity to opt for radical political change: electoral districts with a higher share of jobs exposed to automation were significantly more likely to support Trump. The 2016 U.S. Presidential Election can thus be described as a riot against machines by democratic means.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Frey|first=Carl Benedikt|last2=Berger|first2=Thor|last3=Chen|first3=Chinchih|date=July 23, 2017|title=Political Machinery: Automation Anxiety and the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election|url=https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/Political%20Machinery-Automation%20Anxiety%20and%20the%202016%20U_S_%20Presidential%20Election_230712.pdf}}</ref></blockquote>

=== Results by state ===

The table below displays the official vote tallies by each state's Electoral College voting method. The source for the results of all states is the [https://transition.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2016/federalelections2016.pdf official Federal Election Commission report]. The column labeled "Margin" shows Trump's margin of victory over Clinton (the margin is negative for every state that Clinton won).

A total of 29 [[United States third-party and independent presidential candidates, 2016|third party and independent presidential candidates]] appeared on the ballot in at least one state. Former [[List of Governors of New Mexico|Governor of New Mexico]] [[Gary Johnson]] and physician [[Jill Stein]] repeated their [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] roles as the nominees for the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Geier |first1=Ben |title=The 2016 Presidential Election Could Have Two Spoiler Candidates |url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/27/2016-third-parties/ |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |accessdate=September 25, 2016 |date=June 27, 2016}}</ref> With ballot access to the entire national electorate, Johnson received nearly 4.5 million votes (3.27%), the highest nationwide vote share for a third-party candidate since [[Ross Perot]] in [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lp.org/2016-presidential-ballot-access-map |title=2016 Presidential Ballot Access Map |publisher=}}</ref> while Stein received almost 1.45 million votes (1.06%), the most for a Green nominee since [[Ralph Nader]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]].

Independent candidate [[Evan McMullin]], who appeared on the ballot in 11 states, received over 732,000 votes (0.53%).

[[File:Presidential Election Results Swing by State from 2012 to 2016.svg|thumb|300px|Vote margin swing by state [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] to 2016. Only eleven states (as well as the District of Columbia) trended more Democratic: Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington, Virginia and Utah. The [[2016 United States presidential election in Utah|large swing in Utah]] is mostly, but not completely, due to the votes for third candidate [[Evan McMullin]] and the 2012 candidacy of Utahan [[Mitt Romney]].]]

Most [[News site|media outlets]] announced the beginning of the presidential race about twenty months prior to [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]]. Soon after the first contestants declared their candidacy, [[Larry Sabato]] listed Virginia, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, Florida, Nevada, and Ohio as the seven states most likely to be contested in the [[Elections in the United States|general election]]. After Donald Trump clinched the Republican presidential nomination, many pundits felt that the major campaign locations might be different from what had originally been expected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/05/31/politics/new-jersey-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump/ |title=Poll: Clinton, Trump running tight race in NJ |last=LoBianco |first=Tom |date=May 31, 2016 |website=edition.cnn.com |publisher=CNN|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>

=== Voter demographics ===

Voter demographic data for 2016 were collected by Edison Research for the [[National Election Pool]], a consortium of [[ABC News]], [[CBS News]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]] and the [[Associated Press]]. The voter survey is based on [[exit poll]]s completed by 24,537 voters leaving 350 voting places throughout the [[United States]] on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], in addition to 4,398 telephone interviews with early and absentee voters.<ref>{{cite web |title=exit polls |url=http://edition.cnn.com/election/results/exit-polls/national/president |website=CNN |accessdate=November 10, 2016}}</ref> Trump's crucial victories in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] were aided in large part by his strong margins among [[White people|non-college whites]]‚Äîwhile [[Barack Obama|Obama]] lost those voters by a margin of 10 points in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], Clinton lost this group by 20 percent. The election also represented the first time that [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] performed better among lower-income whites than among affluent white voters.<ref name="ncohncoalition1">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/23/upshot/how-the-obama-coalition-crumbled-leaving-an-opening-for-trump.html |title=How the Obama Coalition Crumbled, Leaving an Opening for Trump |last1=Cohn |first1=Nate |date=December 23, 2016 |accessdate=December 25, 2016 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> To some analysts' surprise, Trump narrowed Clinton's margin compared to Obama by seven points among [[Black people|blacks]] and [[African Americans|African-Americans]], eight points among [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]]s, and 11 points among [[Asian Americans|Asian-Americans]]. Meanwhile, Trump increased his lead with non-Hispanic [[White people|white voters]] through one percent over [[Mitt Romney|Mitt Romney's]] performance, and [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], [[Alaska Natives]], and [[Pacific Islander]]s shifted their support towards the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|Republican]] candidate using the same relative amount.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html |title=Election 2016: Exit Polls |last=Strickland |first=Produced By Jon Huang, Samuel Jacoby, Michael |date=November 8, 2016 |work=The New York Times|access-date=August 8, 2017 |last2=Lai |first2=K. k Rebecca |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Additionally, although 74 percent of [[Islam in the United States|Muslim]] voters supported Clinton, Trump nearly doubled his support among those voters compared to [[Mitt Romney]], according to the ''[[Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations]]'' exit poll.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html |title=Trump Inches Toward Naming Domestic Cabinet Members |date=November 22, 2016 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=November 26, 2016}}</ref> The low percentage of Muslim votes for Trump may have been influenced by much of his rhetoric during the campaign regarding Muslims and Islam.&nbsp; The issue of islamophobia was demonstrated to be an important political issue for Muslim voters; an ISPU study done in 2016 found that, ‚Äú‚Ä¶outside the issues of discrimination and Islamophobia there aren‚Äôt, like, one or two big issues that unite all Muslims.‚Äù<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispu.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/ame2016summary.pdf|title=American Muslims in the 2016 Election and Beyond: Principles and Strategies for Greater Political Engagement, Executive Summary |last=Siddiqui|first=Tasneem|date=2016|website=Institute for Social Policy and Understanding|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

Using wider, more geographically and linguistically representative sampling, Latino Decisions concluded that Clinton won 79% of Hispanic voters (also an improvement over Obama's share in 2008 and 2012), while Trump won only 18% (lower than previous Republicans such as Romney and McCain).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Matt|last1=Barreto|first2=Thomas|last2=Schaller|first3=Gary|last3=Segura|chapter=Latinos and the 2016 Election|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01t7DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|title=Trumped: The 2016 Election That Broke All the Rules|editor1-first=Larry|editor1-last=Sabato|editor2-first=Kyle|editor2-last=Kondik|editor3-first=Geoffrey|editor3-last=Skelley|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|date=2017|pages=123‚Äì35|ISBN=9781442279407}}</ref> Additionally, the 2016 [[Cooperative Congressional Election Study]] found that Clinton's share of the Hispanic vote was one percentage point higher than Obama's in 2012, while Trump's was seven percentage points lower than Romney's.<ref>{{cite web|first=Geoffrey|last=Skelley|date=March 23, 2017|url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/another-look-back-at-2016/|title=Another Look Back at 2016: Comparing the exit poll and the Cooperative Congressional Election Study|website=[[Sabato's Crystal Ball]]|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}</ref>

=== Forecasting ===

{{further|Nationwide opinion polling for the 2016 United States presidential election|Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 United States presidential election}}

Various methods were used to [[Political forecasting|forecast the outcome]] of the 2016 election.<ref name="ef">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml |title=Election forecasting |last1=Stegmaier |first1=Mary |last2=Norpoth |first2=Helmut |date=September 30, 2013|access-date=September 26, 2016 |doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}</ref> For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including [[Nate Silver]]'s [[FiveThirtyEight]], [[The Upshot]] at ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Daily Kos]]'', [[Princeton University|Princeton Election Consortium]], [[Cook Political Report]], [[Stuart Rothenberg|Rothenberg and Gonzales]], PollyVote, [[Sabato's Crystal Ball]] and [[Electoral-vote.com|Electoral-Vote]]. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including [[Nate Silver]] of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at ''The New York Times'', and [[Larry Sabato]] from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/presidential-polls-forecast.html |title=Who will be president? How Other Forecasts Compare |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=September 26, 2016}}</ref> The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting a Clinton victory may have been the result of [[Groupthink#United States presidential election, 2016|groupthink]]. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as having a big number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-trump-could-win-the-white-house-while-losing-the-popular-vote/ |title=How Trump Could Win The White House While Losing The Popular Vote |last=Wasserman |first=David |date=September 15, 2016 |website=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|access-date=February 17, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Early exit polls generally favored Clinton.<ref name=frankluntz/> After the polls closed and some of the results came in, the forecasts were found to be inaccurate, as Trump performed better in the competitive Midwestern states, such as [[Iowa]], [[Ohio]], and [[Minnesota]], than expected. Three states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan) which were considered to be part of Clinton's [[Blue wall (politics)|firewall]], were won by Trump.<ref name=frankluntz>{{Cite news |first=Frank|last=Lutz|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/frank-luntz-ban-exit-polls-231051 |title=Frank Luntz: Ban exit polls |website=[[Politico]]|publisher=[[Capitol News Company]]|location=Arlington, Virginia|date=November 9, 2016|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref> Of the states in the [[Great Lakes|Great Lakes region]], Clinton won the swing state of [[Minnesota]] by one point, as well as traditional Democratic strongholds such as [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]] with populous urban centers. This result stands in contrast to that of [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], when [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] won all but [[Indiana]] and [[North Carolina]], which he carried in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. This table displays the final polling average published by [[RealClearPolitics|Real Clear Politics]] on November 7, the actual electoral margin, and the over-performance by either candidate relative to the polls.

Greeley still garnered three posthumous electoral votes which were subsequently dismissed by Congress.}} Five Democrats rebelled in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Hawaii]], while two Republicans rebelled in [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Detrow |first1=Scott |title=Donald Trump Secures Electoral College Win, With Few Surprises |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/12/19/506188169/donald-trump-poised-to-secure-electoral-college-win-with-few-surprises |accessdate=June 15, 2017 |agency=NPR |date=December 19, 2016}}</ref> Two Democratic electors, one in Minnesota and one in Colorado, were replaced after voting for [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[John Kasich]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Coolican |first1=J.

Likewise, for the first time since [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]],{{efn|Not including [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], because of the death of [[James S. Sherman]].}} multiple faithless electors voted against the pledged qualified vice presidential candidate.

Of the faithless votes, [[Colin Powell]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] were the only two to receive more than one; Powell received three electoral votes for president and Warren received two for vice president. Receiving one valid electoral vote each were Sanders, [[John Kasich]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Faith Spotted Eagle]] for president, and [[Carly Fiorina]], [[Susan Collins]], [[Winona LaDuke]] and [[Maria Cantwell]] for vice president. Sanders is the first [[Jewish American]] to receive an electoral vote for president. LaDuke is the first [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] member to receive an electoral vote, and Paul is the third member of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] to do so, following the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees each getting one vote in [[1972 United States presidential election|1972]]. It is the first election with faithless electors from more than one political party. The seven people to receive electoral votes for president were the most in a single election since [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], and more than any other election since the enactment of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] in 1804.
