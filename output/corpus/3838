There are 538 electors from the 50 states and the District of Columbia.[1] In the 2016 presidential election, 227 electors were female while the remaining 312 electors were male. While every state except Nebraska and Maine chooses the electors by statewide vote, many states require that one elector be designated for each congressional district. These electors are chosen by each party before the general elections. A vote for that party then confirms their position. Except where otherwise noted, such designations refer to the elector's residence in that district rather than election by the voters of the district. Ultimately, Trump received 304 electoral votes and Clinton 227, as two faithless electors defected from Trump and five defected from Clinton.[2] Contents 1 Alabama 2 Alaska 3 Arizona 4 Arkansas 5 California 6 Colorado 7 Connecticut 8 Delaware 9 District of Columbia 10 Florida 11 Georgia 12 Hawaii 12.1 Electors 12.2 First Alternates 12.3 Second Alternates 13 Idaho 14 Illinois 15 Indiana 16 Iowa 17 Kansas 18 Kentucky 19 Louisiana 20 Maine 20.1 Democratic Party 20.2 Republican Party 21 Maryland 22 Massachusetts 23 Michigan 24 Minnesota 25 Mississippi 26 Missouri 27 Montana 28 Nebraska 29 Nevada 30 New Hampshire 31 New Jersey 32 New Mexico 33 New York 34 North Carolina 35 North Dakota 36 Ohio 37 Oklahoma 38 Oregon 39 Pennsylvania 40 Rhode Island 41 South Carolina 42 South Dakota 43 Tennessee 44 Texas 45 Utah 46 Vermont 47 Virginia 48 Washington 49 West Virginia 50 Wisconsin 51 Wyoming 52 See also 53 References 54 External links Alabama[edit] Main article: United States presidential election in Alabama, 2016 Electors: 9, pledged to vote for Donald Trump for president and Mike Pence for vice president[3] Perry O.
