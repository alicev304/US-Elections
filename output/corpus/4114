The convention will be held from August 24 to 27, 2020,[1] at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. By tradition, because Republicans currently hold the White House, their convention will be held after the 2020 Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for August 17–20.[2] Former White House Director of Management and Administration Marcia Lee Kelly, was named convention president and CEO in April 2019[3] making her the first Asian-American to do so for either major political party in American history. [4] On March 17, 2020, President Donald Trump won the Florida and Illinois primaries, giving him more than the required 1,276 delegates to secure the presidential nomination.[citation needed] He had previously announced that Vice President Mike Pence would remain as his vice presidential running mate in his re-election bid.[citation needed] Contents 1 Background 1.1 Site selection 1.2 Controversy 2 Format 2.1 Selection of pledged delegates 2.2 Pre-convention delegate count 2.3 Presidential and vice presidential balloting 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Background[edit] Site selection[edit] Las Vegas, Nevada, and Charlotte, North Carolina were mentioned as possible locations for the 2020 RNC due to their locations within "swing states." Neither had ever hosted a Republican National Convention, although Charlotte had hosted the 2012 Democratic National Convention. A Charlotte television station, WBTV, reported that Charlotte, Las Vegas, and "another unnamed city in Texas, which sources at the meeting said were likely either Dallas or San Antonio" were finalists to host the convention.[5] Other sources named Dallas, Texas[6] and New York City, New York[7] as prospective hosts, while Las Vegas, Nevada,[8][9] Nashville, Tennessee,[10] Philadelphia, Pennsylvania[9], and San Antonio, Texas[6][9] had been under consideration earlier. However, Charlotte was the only city in the country to officially submit a bid for the convention.[11] On July 18, 2018, the RNC Site Selection Committee voted unanimously to recommend holding the convention in Charlotte.[12] The Republican National Committee made the selection official on July 20.[13] Controversy[edit] Following President Trump's rally in Greenville, North Carolina where he used inflammatory language, the Charlotte City Council proposed retracting their bid to host the convention.[14] The city met in closed sessions with an attorney regarding their contract to host the convention. A conclusion was made that breaking the contract would likely end with the city being taken to court and forced to host the convention. A resolution was eventually approved by the Charlotte City Council.[15] Format[edit] Further information: 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries Selection of pledged delegates[edit] The base number of pledged delegates that are allocated to each of the 50 states is 10 at-large delegates, plus 3 district delegates for each congressional district. A fixed number of pledged delegates are allocated to Washington D.C. and each of the five U.S. territories. Bonus delegates are awarded to each state and territory based on whether it has elected (if applicable) through December 31, 2019 (after the 2019 "off-year" elections): a Republican governor, Republican majorities in either one or both chambers in its state legislature, one or two Republicans to the U.S. Senate, or a Republican majority in its delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives. A state is also awarded additional bonus delegates if it carried the Republican candidate, Trump, in the 2016 presidential election.[16] Pre-convention delegate count[edit] The table below reflects the presumed delegate count as per the 2020 Republican primaries. As of November 2019[update], the following estimated numbers of 2440 available pledged delegates and 2550 total delegates may change, as penalty/bonus delegates are awarded to each state and territory based on Republican gains and losses at both the Federal and state level through the 2019 "off-year" elections to the end of December 31, 2019.[17] Pre-convention delegate count Candidate Pledged delegates[17] Presumed "soft" count, including unpledged delegates[17] Donald Trump 1,506 1,544 Bill Weld 1 1 Available delegates 936 1,034 Total delegate votes 2,443 2,550 Several states have canceled their regular delegate selection methods in order to give them to the incumbent president. Presidential and vice presidential balloting[edit] According to party rules agreed to in July 2016, "a candidate has to win a majority of the vote in eight states to have his or her name placed into nomination at the convention."[18] See also[edit] 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries 2020 Democratic National Convention 2020 Libertarian National Convention 2020 Green National Convention 2020 Constitution Party National Convention 2020 United States presidential election Impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on politics References[edit] ^ WCNC Staff, "WCNC: 2020 Republican National Convention dates announced Archived October 2, 2018, at the Wayback Machine", October 1, 2018 ^ "Exclusive: Democrats postpone presidential convention until August 17".
