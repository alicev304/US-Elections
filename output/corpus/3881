The presidential election, House elections, 14 gubernatorial elections, and many state and local elections were held on the same date. In the 2016 Senate elections, 34 of the 100 seats—all class 3 Senate seats—were contested in regular elections; the winners will serve six-year terms until January 3, 2023. Class 3 was last up for election in 2010, when Republicans won a net gain of six seats. In 2016, Democrats defended 10 seats, while Republicans defended 24 seats. Republicans, having won a majority of seats in the Senate in 2014, held the Senate majority with 54 seats before this election. Although Democrats made a net gain of two seats and did not lose any of their seats, Republicans retained control of the Senate for the 115th United States Congress. The two Democratic gains came from the defeats of incumbents Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Mark Kirk in Illinois, to Democrats Maggie Hassan and Tammy Duckworth, respectively. Despite Republicans retaining control of the Senate, 2016 marked the first time since 1986 that Democrats made a net gain of seats in class 3. This is the only election cycle since the popular-election of senators was mandated by the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 that the winning party in every Senate election mirrored the winning party for their state in the presidential election.[1][2] This election marked the first time since 2000 in which the party in opposition to the elected or reelected presidential candidate made net gains in the Senate, with both cases being a Republican president and Democratic gains in the Senate. With the retirement of Harry Reid, Chuck Schumer became the Democratic leader after the elections, while Mitch McConnell retained his position as Senate Majority Leader.

These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use "tossup" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, "lean" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, "likely" or "favored" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage, and "safe" or "solid" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a "tilt" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the "lean" rating would indicate. Where a site gives a percentage probability as its primary indicator of expected outcome, the chart below classifies a race as follows: Tossup: 50-55% Tilt: 56-60% Lean: 61-75% Likely: 76-93% Safe: 94-100% The New York Times's Upshot gave the Democrats a 60% chance of winning the Senate on August 24, 2016;[3] on September 23, their model gave Republicans a 58% chance to maintain control.[4] All seats classified with at least one rating of anything other than "safe" or "solid" are listed below.

It also shows the type of primary. "Open" primary: any registered voter can vote in any party's primary "Closed" primary, only voters registered with a specific party can vote in that party's primary. "Top-two" primary, all candidates run against each other regardless of party affiliation, and the top two candidates advance to the second round of voting. (In Louisiana, a candidate can win the election by winning a majority of the vote in the first round.) All of the various other primary types are classified as "hybrid." Alaska in 2008 provides one example of a hybrid primary: The Democratic Party allowed unaffiliated voters to vote in its primary, while the Republican Party only allowed party members to vote in its primary.[14] State Date[15] Type[14] Alabama Mar. 1R Open Arkansas Mar. 1R Open Illinois Mar 15 Hybrid North Carolina Mar 15 Hybrid Ohio Mar 15 Hybrid Maryland April 26 Hybrid Pennsylvania April 26 Closed Indiana May 3 Open Idaho May 17 Hybrid Kentucky May 17 Closed Oregon May 17 Hybrid Georgia May 24R Open California June 7 Top-two Iowa June 7 Hybrid South Dakota June 7R Hybrid Nevada June 14 Closed North Dakota June 14 Open South Carolina June 14R Hybrid Colorado June 28 Hybrid New York June 28 Closed Oklahoma June 28R Hybrid Utah June 28 Hybrid Kansas Aug 2 Closed Missouri Aug 2 Open Washington Aug 2 Top-two Connecticut Aug 9 Hybrid Vermont Aug 9 Open Wisconsin Aug 9 Open Hawaii Aug 13 Open Alaska Aug 16 Hybrid Arizona Aug 30 Hybrid Florida Aug 30 Closed New Hampshire Sep 13 Hybrid Louisiana Nov 8 Top-two RIndicates a state that requires primary run-off elections under certain conditions.

The primaries were held on March 1. Ron Crumpton, a marijuana legalization activist, was the Democratic nominee.[16] Shelby won re-election with 63.9% of the vote. Shelby was first elected to the Senate in 1986 as a Democrat and was easily re-elected in 1992 as such. He switched his party affiliation to Republican on November 9, 1994, one day after the Republicans won control of both houses in the midterm elections. He won his first full term as a Republican in 1998 by a large margin and faced no significant opposition in 2004 or 2010. Following the divisive Republican primary in Mississippi ahead of the 2014 election in which Senator Thad Cochran was almost defeated, it had been speculated[by whom?] that Shelby could also face a Tea Party primary challenger, due to his lengthy tenure and support for federal largesse. However, that didn't happen, in part due to his large campaign war chest, which stood at $19.4 million as of September 2015.[16] If Shelby had decided to retire, numerous high-profile Alabama Republicans were speculated to run, including U.S. Representatives Robert Aderholt, Mo Brooks, Bradley Byrne, Gary Palmer, Martha Roby, and Mike Rogers, State Treasurer Young Boozer, State Speaker Mike Hubbard, Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey, State Senate President Pro Tempore Del Marsh, Secretary of State John Merrill, U.S. Appeals Court Judge William H. Pryor, Jr., former Governor Bob Riley, and Attorney General Luther Strange.[110][111][112] Shelby announced in January 2015 that he would run for re-election.[113] Republican primary election[114] Party Candidate Votes % Republican Richard Shelby 505,586 64.91% Republican Jonathan McConnell 214,770 27.58% Republican John Martin 23,558 3.02% Republican Marcus Bowman 19,707 2.53% Republican Shadrack McGill 15,230 1.96% Total votes 778,851 100.00% Democratic primary election[114] Party Candidate Votes % Democratic Ron Crumpton 145,681 55.97% Democratic Charles Nana 114,617 44.03% Total votes 260,298 100.00% Alabama general election[115] Party Candidate Votes % Republican Richard Shelby (Incumbent) 1,335,104 63.96% Democratic Ron Crumpton 748,709 35.87% Write-in Others 3,631 0.17% Total votes 2,087,444 100.00% Republican hold Alaska[edit] Alaska election ← 2010 2022 → Nominee Lisa Murkowski Joe Miller Party Republican Libertarian Popular vote 138,149 90,825 Percentage 44.4% 29.2% Nominee Margaret Stock Ray Metcalfe Party Independent Democratic Popular vote 41,194 36,200 Percentage 13.2% 11.6% Results by state house district: Murkowski: 30-40% 40-50% 50-60% Miller: 40-50% U.S. senator before election Lisa Murkowski Republican Elected U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski Republican Main article: 2016 United States Senate election in Alaska See also: List of United States Senators from Alaska Two-term Senator Lisa Murkowski (Republican) was appointed in 2002 and elected to a full term in 2004. She was defeated in the Republican primary in 2010 by Joe Miller. She later ran as a write-in candidate in the 2010 general election and was re-elected to a second full term with 40% of the vote, making her one of two senators in US history to win election via write-in votes. She was 59 years old in 2016. She ran for re-election.[18] Thomas Lamb, a candidate for the State House in 2006, and Bob Lochner filed to run against Murkowski.[116] Other potential Republican primary challengers included 2010 nominee and 2014 candidate Joe Miller, State Senator Mike J. Dunleavy, former Lieutenant Governor Mead Treadwell, and former Mayor of Anchorage Dan Sullivan.[117] The only person to file for the Democratic primary as of May 20 was writer and satirist Richard Grayson, who previously sought election to Wyoming's House seat in 2014.[118][119][120][116] Potential Democratic candidates included State Senator Dennis Egan, State Representative Andy Josephson, State Senator Bill Wielechowski, State Senator Hollis French and State Senate Minority Leader Johnny Ellis.[121] Former Senator Mark Begich was mentioned as a possible candidate,[122] but he declined to run.[123] Murkowski won her primary on August 16, 2016 with 72 percent of the vote. Joe Miller received the Libertarian nomination and will run against Murkowski in the general election.
