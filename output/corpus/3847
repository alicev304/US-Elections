The series of primaries, caucuses, and state conventions culminated in the national convention, where the delegates cast their votes to formally select a candidate. A simple majority (1,237) of the total delegate votes (2,472) was required to become the party's nominee and was achieved by the nominee, businessman Donald Trump of New York. The process began on March 23, 2015, when Texas Senator Ted Cruz became the first presidential candidate to announce his intentions to seek the office of United States President. That summer, 17 major candidates were recognized by national and state polls, making it the largest presidential candidate field for any single political party in American history.[2] The large field made possible the fact that the 2016 primaries were the first since 1968 (and the first in which every state held a contest) in which more than three candidates won at least one state. When voting began in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, twelve major candidates were actively campaigning; these were (ordered by date of withdrawal from the race) former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, businesswoman and former Hewlett-Packard Chief Executive Officer Carly Fiorina, former Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, former neurosurgeon and Johns Hopkins University Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery Ben Carson, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Governor John Kasich of Ohio, and the eventual nominee, businessman and Trump Organization CEO Donald Trump. Following poor results from the first-in-the-nation caucus, Huckabee was the first candidate to drop out.[3] Santorum also ended his campaign after a poor performance in Iowa.[4] Paul withdrew from the race after placing fifth in Iowa, and subsequently polling poorly leading into the New Hampshire primary.[4] Christie, who put nearly all of his campaign's resources into the critical state of New Hampshire, withdrew on February 10, 2016, after finishing sixth in the state.[5] Following Christie's announcement, Fiorina suspended her campaign, which was unable to gain traction. Gilmore, who severely lacked funding, campaign infrastructure, and support, surprised many political pundits by staying in the race as far as he did; he dropped out shortly after the New Hampshire primary.[6] Bush withdrew from actively campaigning after finishing fourth in the South Carolina primary.[7] After Super Tuesday, Carson announced that there would be "no path forward" for his bid for the Presidency, effectively suspending his campaign.[8] On March 15, 2016, Rubio dropped out after losing his home state, leaving three active candidates (Cruz, Kasich, and Trump).[9] Trump's resounding victory in the Indiana primary on May 3, 2016, prompted Cruz's exit from the race. The following day, Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee after Kasich dropped out. Trump was formally nominated by the delegates of the 2016 Republican National Convention on July 19, 2016, and proceeded to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the general election on November 8, 2016, to become the 45th President of the United States.

Other candidates[edit] Prior to the Iowa caucuses, five major candidates, who had been invited to the debates, had withdrawn from the race after states began to certify candidates for ballot spots: Rick Perry, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Lindsey Graham, and George Pataki. Other candidates, nearly 15 in New Hampshire alone, were able to make it on the ballot in individual states. Some votes for minor candidates are unavailable, because in many states (territories) they can be listed as Others or Write-ins. Since the beginning of the primary season, none of these other candidates have been awarded any delegates.

But the actual election of the delegates can be at a later date. Delegates are (1) elected at conventions, (2) from slates submitted by the candidates, (3) selected by the state chairman or (4) at committee meetings or (5) elected directly at the caucuses and primaries. Until the delegates are actually elected the delegate numbers are by nature projections, but it is only in the nonbinding caucus states where they are not allocated at the primary or caucus date.

It will include Republican primaries in nine states and caucuses in two states, totaling 595 delegates (24.1% of the total). North Dakota holds the last caucus on Super Tuesday, but there is no presidential straw poll, and all the delegates elected later at its convention will be unbound. Colorado and Wyoming take a straw poll, but it is non-binding, and no delegates are allocated on Super Tuesday. The 2016 schedule has been dubbed the "SEC Primary", since many of the participating states are represented in the U.S. collegiate Southeastern Conference.[13][14] The participating states include Alabama, Alaska caucuses, Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota caucuses, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and Virginia.[14] Super Tuesday map Super Tuesday 2016 (Republican Party, results) Super Tuesday overview Candidate States won Votes Projected delegate count TGP CNN[15] FOX[16] Donald Trump 7 2,955,120 254 251 237 Ted Cruz 3 2,502,557 218 212 209 Marco Rubio 1 1,881,068 96 97 94 John Kasich 0 546,465 21 21 19 Ben Carson 0 493,912 3 3 3 Unprojected delegates: 3 11 33 Total: 11 8,581,841 595 595 595 Alabama[edit] Main article: United States presidential election in Alabama, 2016 Primary date: March 1, 2016 National delegates: 50 County results of the Alabama Republican presidential primaries, 2016 Donald Trump Alabama Republican primary, March 1, 2016 Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Donald Trump 373,721 43.42% 36 0 36 Ted Cruz 181,479 21.09% 13 0 13 Marco Rubio 160,606 18.66% 1 0 1 Ben Carson 88,094 10.24% 0 0 0 John Kasich 38,119 4.43% 0 0 0 Uncommitted 7,953 0.92% 0 0 0 Jeb Bush (withdrawn) 3,974 0.46% 0 0 0 Mike Huckabee (withdrawn) 2,539 0.30% 0 0 0 Rand Paul (withdrawn) 1,895 0.22% 0 0 0 Chris Christie (withdrawn) 858 0.10% 0 0 0 Rick Santorum (withdrawn) 617 0.07% 0 0 0 Carly Fiorina (withdrawn) 544 0.06% 0 0 0 Lindsey Graham (withdrawn) 253 0.03% 0 0 0 Unprojected delegates: 0 0 0 Total: 860,652 100.00% 50 0 50 Source: The Green Papers Alaska[edit] Main article: United States presidential election in Alaska, 2016 Primary date: March 1, 2016 National delegates: 28 Borough results of the Alaska Republican presidential primaries, 2016 Donald Trump Ted Cruz Ben Carson Alaska Republican legislative district conventions, March 1, 2016 Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Ted Cruz 8,369 36.37% 12 0 12 Donald Trump 7,740 33.64% 11 0 11 Marco Rubio 3,488 15.16% 5 0 5 Ben Carson 2,492 10.83% 0 0 0 John Kasich 918 3.99% 0 0 0 Unprojected delegates: 0 0 0 Total: 23,010 100.00% 28 0 28 Source: The Green Papers and Alaska Republican Party Arkansas[edit] Main article: United States presidential election in Arkansas, 2016 Primary date: March 1, 2016 National delegates: 40 County results of the Arkansas Republican presidential caucuses, 2016.
