Ted Cruz Donald Trump Marco Rubio Tie The 2016 Iowa Republican caucuses took place on February 1 in the U.S. state of Iowa, traditionally marking the Republican Party's first nominating contest in their series of presidential primaries ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The Democratic Party held its own Iowa caucuses on the same day. Ted Cruz was able to defeat Donald Trump in the Iowa Caucus by winning over evangelical and libertarian caucus-goers;[1] Cruz won 51,666 caucus votes or 27.6%, giving him a net gain of one delegate over Trump. Mike Huckabee, the 2008 Iowa Caucus winner, dropped out following a poor performance in the caucus. While Cruz had the endorsement of Congressman Steve King of the 4th Congressional District in rural northwest Iowa,[2] and was able to consolidate devout Evangelical support in the Sioux City area, he was snubbed by Terry Branstad, the popular Republican Governor at the time. Trump tried to make a run among the majority-Catholic mill towns of Mississippi River valley, but Cruz's religious support was stronger than most polls anticipated.[3] Contents 1 Procedure 2 Forums and debates 3 Results 4 Controversy 5 References 6 External links Procedure[edit] According to the Republican Party of Iowa's bylaws, if more than one candidate is nominated at the Republican National Convention, all of Iowa's delegates are bound to vote "proportionally in accordance with the outcome of the Iowa Caucuses" on the first ballot, even if the candidate has withdrawn from the race.[4] The ballot is a blank piece of paper, and the candidates that voters may vote for in the non-binding preference poll included the following: Jeb Bush Ben Carson Chris Christie Ted Cruz Carly Fiorina Jim Gilmore John Kasich Marco Rubio Donald Trump Rand Paul Rick Santorum Mike Huckabee Forums and debates[edit] November 20, 2015 – Des Moines, Iowa The Presidential Family Forum was held in the Community Choice Credit Union Convention Center in Des Moines, Iowa.
