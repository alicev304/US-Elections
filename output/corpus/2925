About twice as many Ohioans said, after voting, that they had been contacted by an Obama volunteer urging their vote as said they had been contacted by a McCain supporter. That advantage helped Mr. Obama win Ohio's electoral votes, which went to George W. Bush in 2000 and 2004. An Ohio Republican leader said Mr. Obama's voter turnout organization had played a powerful role as Democrats picked up at least five seats in the 99-member Ohio House, gaining a majority. "In some of our seats it was too much to overcome," said State Representative Matthew J. Dolan, chairman of Ohio's House Republican Campaign Committee. Republicans held on to their 21-12 edge in the Ohio Senate. Democrats had hoped to pick up as many as four seats in Ohio's 18-member Congressional delegation, where Republicans have held an 11-7 advantage, partly because three Republican incumbents are retiring. But Republicans kept two of those open seats, and the delegation will be split, 9-9. The Democrats gained one Congressional seat in Cincinnati, where State Representative Steven Driehaus, a fiscally conservative Democrat, defeated Steve Chabot, an eight-term Republican who was a prosecutor during President Clinton's impeachment. The other Democratic gain came in the district that includes Canton and has been represented since 1973 by Ralph Regula, who is retiring. There, State Senator John Boccieri, an Iraq veteran, defeated State Senator Kirk Schuring.
