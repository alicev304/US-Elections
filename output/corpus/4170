List of governors of Virginia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article History of Virginia By year Pre-statehood American Revolution U.S. Civil War Post-Civil War Topics: Cities - Politics - Slavery Virginia portal v t e The following is a list of the Governors of the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Governor is the head of the executive branch of Virginia's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor has the duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Virginia General Assembly, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of impeachment.[1] The first Constitution of 1776 created the office of Governor, to be elected annually by the Virginia State Legislature. The Governor could serve up to three years at a time, and once out of office, could not serve again for four years.[2] The 1830 constitution changed the thrice renewable one-year term length to a non-renewable three-year term, and set the start date at the first day in January following an election.[3] This constitution also prevented governors from succeeding themselves, a prohibition that exists to the present day.[4] The 1851 Constitution increased terms to four years[5] and made the office elected by the people, rather than the legislature.[6] The commencement of the Governor's term was moved to the first day in February by the 1902 Constitution,[7] and then to the Saturday after the second Wednesday in January by the 1971 and current Constitution.[8] If the office of governor is vacant due to disqualification, death, or resignation, the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia becomes Governor.[9] The office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1851.[10] Prior to that a Council of State existed; it chose from among its members a President who would be "Lieutenant-Governor" and would act as governor when there was a vacancy in that office.[2][11] Officially, there have been 73 Governors of Virginia; the Acting Governors are not counted.
