[5] Judge Rosemary M. Collyer of the U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C. the legal challenge, ruling that "Johnson and Stein have no standing to make antitrust and First Amendment challenges to the CPD’s rules (which require a third-party candidate to average 15 percent support in five national polls in the run-up to debates), because the 'Defendants here are private parties.'"[6] Liberty Tour 2016[edit] During the 2016 election, Our America Initiative sponsored a national tour, "visiting college campuses and other venues across America to raise awareness about third party inclusion in national presidential debates."[7] The tour made stops in 40 states; speakers included Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld, Unleash Your Inner Company author John Chisholm, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition executive director and former Baltimore Police Chief Neill Franklin, Free the People's Matt Kibbe, Republicans Ed Lopez and Liz Mair, Conscious Capitalism’s Alex McCobin, Reason Foundation’s David Nott, Foundation for Economic Education’s Jeffrey Tucker, the Libertarian Party's Carla Howell, former Delaware attorney general and over-criminalization activist Ken Abraham, and author and journalist Naomi Wolf as well as comedians Jeremy McClellan, Viceland’s Travis Irvine, and We the Internet’s Lou Perez.[8][9] References[edit] ^ New Mexico Governors Archived 2012-02-27 at the Wayback Machine.
