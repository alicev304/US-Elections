The Federal Government largely has missed out on that transformation due to poor management of technology investments, with IT projects too often costing hundreds of millions of dollars more than they should, taking years longer than necessary to deploy, and delivering technologies that are obsolete by the time they are completed. We are working to close the resulting gap between the best performing private sector organizations and the federal government. The Office of E-Government and Information Technology (E-Gov), headed by the Federal Government’s Chief Information Officer (CIO), develops and provides direction in the use of Internet-based technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to interact with the Federal Government, save taxpayer dollars, and streamline citizen participation.

They highlight where agencies have applied enterprise architecture methodologies to solve specific business problems which has resulted in programmatic success. Each quarter, the FEAPMO will feature new success stories as identified by the agencies. DOD Success Story The DoD’s High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP) is responsible for providing some of the world’s most advanced computing capability in support of the DoD mission. The nation-wide Defense Research and Engineering Network (DREN) provides the HPCMP user community with protocol-rich, high-availability, high-capacity, low-latency, secure connectivity. In June, 2003, the DREN was designated as the first DoD IPv6 pilot network. This DOD success highlights six keys to success and eight challenges that were overcome without additional personnel and with less than $100,000 in additional funding. EPA Success Story Each year Industry reports toxics releases to EPA which is shared with State agencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb significantly reduces the reporting burden of facilities filing via web, abates EPA and state programs data collection transaction costs, and delivers impressive program performance efficiencies. The 2007 TRI-MEweb is a leap forward towards a one-stop-shop paperless TRI reporting system. FBI Success Story In late 2007, former Associate Deputy Director, Joseph L. Ford, determined that centrally managing license agreements for Information Technology (IT) was a critical need and would provide an opportunity for huge cost savings and improved efficiencies. During just four quarters of its existence, the program has proved its worth by recording a total FY 2008 cost savings/avoidance of $14,869,700, while also recording an additional $49,394,266 in out-year cost savings for FY 2009 through FY 2012.
