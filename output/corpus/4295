Throughout the evening Sanders maintained a lead over Clinton. However St. Louis County and Jackson County, home of a large section of Kansas City, came in late and it was just enough to push Clinton over the finish line. Senator Sanders refused to request a recount citing concerns over wasting taxpayer dollars.[6] Missouri Democratic primary, March 15, 2016 Candidate Popular vote Estimated delegates Count Percentage Pledged Unpledged Total Hillary Clinton 312,285 49.61% 36 11 47 Bernie Sanders 310,711 49.36% 35 2 37 Henry Hewes 650 0.10% Martin O'Malley (withdrawn) 442 0.07% Jon Adams 433 0.07% Rocky De La Fuente 345 0.05% Willie Wilson 307 0.05% Keith Russell Judd 288 0.05% John Wolfe Jr. 247 0.04% Uncommitted 3,717 0.59% 0 0 0 Total 629,425 100% 71 13 84 Source: The Green Papers, Missouri Secretary of State - Official Primary Results State of Missouri Democratic primary, March 15, 2016 District Delegates Votes Clinton Votes Sanders Votes Qualified Clinton delegates Sanders delegates 1 10 85656 59567 145223 6 4 2 6 46785 49661 96446 3 3 3 5 28983 35664 64647 2 3 4 5 26178 33428 59606 2 3 5 7 51696 45974 97670 4 3 6 5 28786 32129 60915 2 3 7 4 21574 31389 52963 2 2 8 5 20944 21259 42203 2 3 Total 47 310,602 309,071 619,673 23 24 PLEO 9 310,602 309,071 619,673 5 4 At Large 15 310,602 309,071 619,673 8 7 Gr.

With Sanders winning men 56-44, voters under the age of 45 67-32, and white voters 54-45, Clinton won among women 54-44, older voters 62-37, and African American voters 67-32. Sanders won among voters who made less than $50k and $100k per year, with Clinton winning more affluent voters. And while Sanders won 67-33 among self-identified Independents who made up 24% of the electorate, Clinton won 55-44 among the 74% of voters who identified as Democrats. While Sanders won among liberals 53-46, Clinton won moderates and conservatives 55-44. Sanders was able to win 54-45 among union households, a key voting bloc in the industrial Midwest, and he won 53-46 among those who believe trade with other countries takes away U.S. jobs; trade deals championed by Bill and Hillary Clinton have not always gone over well in the industrial Rust Belt. In terms of each voters' family financial situation, voters who were "getting ahead" or "holding steady" opted for Clinton, while those who felt they were "falling behind" overwhelmingly favored Sanders.[8] Clinton won a large victory in St. Louis City and St. Louis County (she won 55-44 according to exit polls, likely thanks to her ardent African American support), and she also managed a 51-48 victory in Kansas City on the western side of the state. Sanders, meanwhile, won victories in Columbia and Springfield, keeping the race close statewide, and won in the largely white, rural and more conservative counties, including areas of Northwestern Missouri bordering Kansas and Nebraska, and Southwestern Missouri bordering Oklahoma. All three neighboring states are Great Plains states that Sanders won earlier in March.
