P. Hunt Formation February 14, 1912 Deputy None Salary $95,000 (2013)[3] Website official site The Governor of Arizona is the head of government and head of state of the U.S. state of Arizona.[4] In their role as head of government, the governor is the head of the executive branch of the Arizona state government and is charged with enforcing state laws.[4] The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Arizona State Legislature[5]; to convene the legislature[4]; and to grant pardons[6], except in cases of impeachment. The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[7] Twenty-two people have served as governor over 26 distinct terms. All of the repeat governors were in the state's earliest years, when George W. P. Hunt and Thomas Edward Campbell alternated as governor for 17 years and, after a two-year gap, Hunt served another term. One governor, Evan Mecham, was successfully impeached, and one, Fife Symington, resigned upon being convicted of a felony. The longest-serving governor was Hunt, who was elected seven times and served just under fourteen years. The longest single stint was that of Bruce Babbitt, who was elected to two four-year terms after succeeding to the office following the death of his predecessor, Wesley Bolin, serving nearly nine years total. Bolin had the shortest tenure, dying less than five months after succeeding as governor. Four governors were actually born in Arizona: Campbell, Sidney Preston Osborn, Rose Mofford, and Babbitt. Arizona has had four female governors, the most in the United States, and is also the only state where female governors have served consecutively.[8] Because of a string of deaths in office, resignations, and an impeachment, Arizona has not had a governor whose term both began and ended because of "normal" election circumstances since Jack Williams was in office, from 1967 to 1975. The current Governor is Republican Doug Ducey, who took office on January 5, 2015.

Owings, provisional governor of the Arizona Territory (from 1860 to 1861) and 2nd Confederate governor of Arizona Territory. Lieut. Col. John R. Baylor, first Confederate territorial governor from 1861 to 1862. In Tucson between April 2 and April 5, 1860, a convention of settlers from the southern half of New Mexico Territory drafted a provisional constitution for "Arizona Territory," three years before the United States would create such a territory. This proposed territory consisted of the part of New Mexico Territory south of 33° 40' north. On April 2,[9] they elected a governor, Dr. Lewis S. Owings. The provisional territory was to exist until such time as an official territory was created, but that proposal was rejected by the U.S. Congress at the time.[10] On March 16, 1861, soon before the American Civil War broke out, a convention in Mesilla voted that the provisional territory should secede from the Union and join the Confederacy.[11] Dr. Lewis S. Owings remained on as the provisional governor of the territory. The Confederacy took ownership of the territory on August 1, 1861, when forces led by Lieutenant Colonel John R. Baylor won decisive control of the territory, and Baylor proclaimed himself governor.[12] The Arizona Territory (Confederate) was formally organized on January 18, 1862.[13] On March 20, 1862, Baylor issued an order to kill all the adult Apache and take their children into slavery.[12] When Confederate President Jefferson Davis learned of this order, he strongly disapproved and demanded an explanation. Baylor wrote a letter December 29, 1862, to justify his decision, and after this was received, Davis relieved Baylor of his post and commission, calling his letter an "avowal of an infamous crime."[14] By that time, the Confederate government of Arizona Territory was in exile in San Antonio, Texas, as the territory had been effectively lost to Union forces in July 1862;[15] no new governor was appointed. Governors of the Territory of Arizona[edit] Arizona Territory was formed on February 24, 1863 from New Mexico Territory, remaining a territory for 49 years.[16] Governors of the Territory of Arizona No. Governor Term in office[a] Appointing President — John A.

The state constitution of 1912 called for the election of a governor every two years.[56] The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment.[57][58] The constitution originally included no term limit,[59] but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once;[56] before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first Monday in the January following the election.[56] Governors who have served the two term limit can run again after four years out of office. Arizona is one of seven states which does not have a lieutenant governor; instead, in the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the Secretary of State, if elected, succeeds to the office. If the secretary of state was appointed, rather than elected, or is otherwise ineligible to hold the office of governor, the first elected and eligible person in the line of succession assumes the office. The state constitution specifies the line of succession to be the Secretary of State, Attorney General, State Treasurer and Superintendent of Public Instruction, in that order.[60] If the governor is out of the state or impeached, the next elected officer in the line of succession becomes acting governor until the governor returns or is cleared.[60] To date, the line of succession has gone beyond the secretary of state only once, when Bruce Babbitt, as attorney general, became governor upon the death of Wesley Bolin; the secretary of state at the time, Rose Mofford, was an appointee to replace Bolin,[61] who himself had succeeded to the office due to the resignation of his predecessor, Raúl Héctor Castro. Mofford would later succeed Evan Mecham as acting governor when he was impeached by the House of Representatives, and as governor when he was convicted by the Senate.

Due to the distance from Washington, D.C., to Arizona, many governors were appointed and confirmed months before being able to exercise power in the territory. ^ Gurley died on August 19, 1863, prior to taking office as governor. ^ Goodwin resigned to take office in the United States House of Representatives.[19] ^ McCormick resigned to take office in the United States House of Representatives.[21] ^ It is unknown when Frémont took the oath of office; Goff states that he and his family arrived in Prescott on the afternoon of October 6, 1878.[24] ^ Frémont resigned; he spent little time in the territory; and the Secretary of the Territory asked him to resume his duties or resign, and he chose resignation.[25] ^ Tritle resigned after Grover Cleveland was elected, so that the Democrat could appoint a Democrat as governor.[27] ^ Wolfley resigned due to a disagreement with the federal government on arid land policy.[31] ^ Irwin resigned to handle family business out of state.[34] ^ Hughes had abolished many territorial offices, and unhappy officials successfully petitioned President Cleveland to remove him.[39] ^ McCord resigned to serve in the Spanish–American War.[45] ^ Asked by President Theodore Roosevelt to resign for opposing the Newlands Reclamation Act.[49] ^ Brodie resigned to accept appointment as assistant chief of the records and pension bureau at the United States Department of War.[52] ^ Data is sourced from the National Governors Association, unless supplemental references are required. ^ The governor's website labeled Doug Ducey as the 23rd governor;[62] based on this, each governor is numbered only once, regardless of how many distinct terms they served. Repeat terms are listed with the governor's original number in italics. ^ a b Initial results showed that Campbell had won by 30 votes, but Hunt challenged the results, claiming that several precincts had experienced fraudulent voting.[64] The Arizona Supreme Court named Campbell governor on January 27, 1917, and forced Hunt to surrender his office.[65] Hunt continued fighting in court, and on December 22, 1917, was declared the winner of the election by 43 votes.[66] Campbell vacated the office three days later.[67] ^ Hunt lost the Democratic nomination to Benjamin Baker Moeur.[70] ^ Moeur lost the Democratic nomination to Rawghlie Clement Stanford.[71] ^ Jones lost the Democratic nomination to Sidney Preston Osborn.[72] ^ Garvey lost the Democratic nomination to Ana Frohmiller.[73] ^ McFarland instead unsuccessfully ran for United States Senate.[74] ^ Fannin instead successfully ran for United States Senate.[74] ^ First term under a constitutional amendment which lengthened terms to four years.[57] ^ Castro resigned to take post as United States Ambassador to Argentina.[76] ^ a b While the constitutional date for when Mecham succeeded Babbitt is January 5, 1987, sources are split between saying the inauguration happened on January 5[77] or January 6.[78] ^ The secretary of state at the time of Bolin's death had been appointed,[61] not elected, and thus not in the line of succession according to the Arizona constitution.[60] Therefore, as attorney general, Babbitt became governor.[79] ^ Mecham was impeached and removed from office on charges of obstruction of justice and misuse of government funds,[78] though he was later acquitted.[80] ^ a b c Arizona adopted runoff voting after Evan Mecham won with only 43% of the vote in 1986. The 1990 election was very close, and a runoff was held on February 26, 1991, which Symington won, and he was inaugurated on March 6, 1991.[83] ^ Symington resigned after being convicted of bank fraud; the conviction was later overturned and he was pardoned by President Bill Clinton.[81][82] ^ Napolitano resigned to be United States Secretary of Homeland Security.[8] ^ Ducey's second term began on January 7, 2019, and will expire on January 2, 2023.
