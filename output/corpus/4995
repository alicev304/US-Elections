While California has had a top-two candidates open primary system since 2011,[3] presidential primaries are still partisan races. Registered members of each party may only vote in their party's presidential primary. Unaffiliated voters may choose any one primary in which to vote, if the party allows such voters to participate.[3] For 2016, the American Independent, Democratic, and Libertarian parties have chosen to allow voters registered with no party preference to request their respective party's presidential ballots.[4] Democratic primary[edit] Main article: 2016 California Democratic primary Democratic primary results by county.

Ventura Davis Yolo West Sacramento Winters Woodland Marysville Yuba Trump Wheatland Counties that swung from Republican to Democratic[edit] Nevada (largest town: Truckee) Orange (largest city: Anaheim) Analysis[edit] California has voted Democratic in every presidential election since Republican George H. W. Bush won the state in 1988. Hillary Clinton easily continued the Democratic tradition in California, winning the state with 61.7% of the vote, Clinton's second highest vote percentage of any state, behind Hawaii. Donald Trump received 31.6% of the vote, a Democratic victory margin of 30.11 points.[16] California was one of eleven states where Hillary Clinton outperformed outgoing President Barack Obama in 2012, and contributed to Clinton's national popular vote victory.[13] The California state result was historically one of the most successful for the Democratic Party nominee by several measures, as Hillary Clinton carried California by the largest margin of any Democratic candidate since Franklin D. Roosevelt swept the state by 35.25% in his 1936 re-election landslide.[17] Clinton was also the first Democrat since FDR in 1936 to win traditionally Republican Orange County.[18] Clinton received nearly 72% of the vote in Los Angeles County, making her the first Democratic presidential candidate in history to receive over 70% of the vote in Los Angeles County,[failed verification] the most heavily populated county in the United States.[19][20] This state would prove to be vital in Hillary Clinton's popular vote victory in the 2016 election, since if one were to remove California for the equation, Trump would win the popular vote by roughly 1.5 million votes.
