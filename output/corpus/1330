President before election Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican Elected President James Madison Democratic-Republican The 1808 United States presidential election was the sixth quadrennial presidential election, held from Friday, November 4, to Wednesday, December 7, 1808. The Democratic-Republican candidate James Madison defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney decisively. Madison's victory made him the first individual to succeed a president of the same party. Madison had served as Secretary of State since President Thomas Jefferson took office in 1801. Jefferson, who had declined to run for a third term, threw his strong support behind Madison, a fellow Virginian. Sitting Vice President George Clinton and former Ambassador James Monroe both challenged Madison for leadership of the party, but Madison won his party's nomination and Clinton was re-nominated as vice president. The Federalists chose to re-nominate Pinckney, a former ambassador who had served as the party's 1804 nominee. Despite the unpopularity of the Embargo Act of 1807, Madison won the vast majority of electoral votes outside of the Federalist stronghold of New England. Clinton received six electoral votes for president from his home state of New York. This election was the first of two instances in American history in which a new president was selected but the incumbent vice president won re-election, the other being in 1828.

With Thomas Jefferson ready to retire, supporters of Secretary of State James Madison of Virginia worked carefully to ensure that Madison would succeed Jefferson. Madison's primary competition came from former diplomat James Monroe of Virginia and Vice President George Clinton. Monroe was supported by a group known as the tertium quids, who supported a weak central government and were dissatisfied by the Louisiana Purchase and the Compact of 1802. Clinton's support came from Northern Democratic-Republicans who disapproved of the Embargo Act (which they saw as potentially leading towards war with Great Britain) and who sought to end the Virginia Dynasty. The Congressional caucus met in January 1808, choosing Madison as its candidate for president and Clinton as its candidate for vice president.[2] Many supporters of Monroe and Clinton refused to accept the result of the caucus. Monroe was nominated by a group of Virginia Democratic-Republicans, and although he did not actively try to defeat Madison, he also refused to withdraw from the race.[3] Clinton was also supported by a group of New York Democratic-Republicans for president even as he remained the party's official vice presidential candidate.[4] Balloting[edit] Presidential Ballot Total Vice Presidential Ballot Total James Madison 83 George Clinton 79 James Monroe 3 John Langdon 5 George Clinton 3 Henry Dearborn 3 John Quincy Adams 1 Federalist Party nomination[edit] Federalist Party Ticket, 1808 Charles C. Pinckney Rufus King for President for Vice President Former U.S. Minister to France (1796–1797) Former U.S. Minister to Great Britain (1796–1803) Campaign The Federalist caucus met in September 1808 and re-nominated the party's 1804 ticket, which consisted of General Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York.[5] General election[edit] Campaign[edit] The election was marked by opposition to Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807, a halt to trade with Europe that disproportionately hurt New England merchants and was perceived as favoring France over Britain. Nonetheless, Jefferson was still very popular with Americans generally and Pinckney was soundly defeated by Madison, though not as badly as in 1804. Pinckney received few electoral votes outside of New England. Results[edit] Pinckney retained the electoral votes of the two states that he carried in 1804 (Connecticut and Delaware), and he also picked up New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and three electoral districts in North Carolina besides the two electoral districts in Maryland that he carried earlier. Except for the North Carolina districts, all of the improvement was in New England. Monroe won a portion of the popular vote in Virginia and North Carolina,[3] while the New York legislature split its electoral votes between Madison and Clinton.[4] Electoral results Presidential candidate Party Home state Popular vote(a), (b) Electoral vote(c) Running mate Count Percentage Vice-presidential candidate Home state Electoral vote(c) James Madison Democratic-Republican Virginia 124,732 64.7% 122 George Clinton (incumbent) New York 113 John Langdon New Hampshire 9 Charles Cotesworth Pinckney Federalist South Carolina 62,431 32.4% 47 Rufus King New York 47 George Clinton Democratic-Republican New York — — 6 James Madison Virginia 3 James Monroe Virginia 3 James Monroe Democratic-Republican Virginia 4,848 2.5% 0 None N/A 0 Unpledged electors None N/A 680 0.4% 0 N/A N/A 0 Total 192,691 100% 175 175 Needed to win 88 88 Source (Popular Vote): U.S. President National Vote.
