List of presidents of the United States by age From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from List of Presidents of the United States by age) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikimedia list article This is a list of presidents of the United States by age. The first table charts the age of each United States president at the time of presidential inauguration (first inauguration if elected to multiple and consecutive terms), upon leaving office, and at the time of death. Where the president is still living, their lifespan is calculated up to April 28, 2020. The second table includes those presidents who had the distinction among their peers of being the oldest living president, and charts both when they became and ceased to be the oldest living. Contents 1 Age of presidents 2 Presidential age-related data 2.1 Notes 3 Oldest living 3.1 Note 4 References 5 Sources Age of presidents[edit] See also: Lifespan timeline of presidents of the United States Age of presidents when assuming office approximately follows a bell curve The median age upon accession to the presidency is 55 years and 3 months. This is how old Lyndon B. Johnson was at the time of his first inauguration. The youngest person to assume the presidency was Theodore Roosevelt, who, at the age of 42 years, 322 days, succeeded to the office after the assassination of William McKinley. The youngest to become president by election was John F. Kennedy, who was 43 years, 236 days, at his inauguration. The oldest person to assume the presidency was Donald Trump, at the age of 70 years, 220 days, on Inauguration Day. Assassinated three years into his term, John F. Kennedy was the youngest at the time of his departure from office (46 years, 177 days); the youngest president to leave office at the conclusion of a normal transition was Theodore Roosevelt (50 years, 128 days). The oldest at the time of leaving office was Ronald Reagan (77 years, 349 days). The president born after the greatest number of his successors is John F. Kennedy. He was born after four of his successors: Lyndon Johnson (8 years, 9 months, and 2 days); Ronald Reagan (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); Richard Nixon (4 years, 4 months, and 16 days); and Gerald Ford (3 years, 10 months, and 15 days). On the other extreme, Ronald Reagan was born before four of his predecessors: Richard Nixon (1 year, 11 months, and 7 days); Gerald Ford (2 years, 5 months, and 8 days); John F. Kennedy (6 years, 3 months, and 23 days); and Jimmy Carter (13 years, 7 months, and 25 days). The oldest living president is Jimmy Carter, born October 1, 1924, who is aged 95 years, 210 days. On March 22, 2019, he also became the nation's longest-lived president, surpassing the lifespan of George H. W. Bush, who died at the age of 94 years, 171 days. Additionally, Carter has had the longest post-presidency, now lasting 39 years, 99 days. The youngest living president is Barack Obama, born August 4, 1961 (age 58 years, 268 days). The shortest-lived president who died of natural causes was James K. Polk, who died of cholera at the age of 53 years, 225 days—103 days after he left office. Six presidents have lived into their 90s. The first to do so, John Adams, was the longest-lived president for nearly two centuries, from 1803 until Ronald Reagan surpassed his lifespan, in October 2001.[1][2] The six nonagenarian presidents, arranged by lifespan: Jimmy Carter Born October 1, 1924 (age 95 years, 210 days) George H.

Oldest living[edit] See also: Living presidents of the United States Of the 44 people who have served as president, 24 have become the oldest such individual of their time, with one, William Howard Taft, doing so twice. Herbert Hoover held the distinction for the longest period of any, from the death of Calvin Coolidge in January 1933 until his own death 31 years later. Lyndon B. Johnson held it for the shortest, from the death of Harry S. Truman in December 1972 until his own death only 27 days later. Theodore Roosevelt, at age 49, is the youngest individual to become the oldest living president; Jimmy Carter became the oldest to acquire the distinction at age 94. (Nine of these individuals have also had the distinction of being the oldest living U.S. vice president: John Adams, Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and George H. W. Bush.) On three occasions the oldest living president lost the distinction not by his death, but by the inauguration of a president who was older: Theodore Roosevelt (born 1858) to William Howard Taft (born 1857) in 1909; Taft to Woodrow Wilson (born 1856) in 1913 (though Taft later regained the honor, as he outlived Wilson); and Richard Nixon (born 1913) to Ronald Reagan (born 1911) in 1981. Eleven presidents have held the distinction while in office. In the cases of George Washington, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Ronald Reagan this occurred upon their inauguration as they were older than their living predecessors (or, in Washington's case, had no predecessors). In the cases of John Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover and Richard Nixon, this happened at the same time as their becoming the only living president; in the cases of Andrew Jackson and Benjamin Harrison, the only other living president at the time was a younger predecessor, John Quincy Adams and Grover Cleveland respectively. By contrast, the president who acquired the distinction furthest from his time in office was Jimmy Carter, who had been retired for 37 years, 314 days when he became the oldest living president, upon the death of George H. W. Bush.
