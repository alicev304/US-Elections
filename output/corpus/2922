Kasich of Ohio won re-election easily, with the help of a series of missteps and uncomfortable revelations by the Democratic candidate, Ed FitzGerald. Mr. FitzGerald, the Cuyahoga County executive, lost staff members and donors after reports that two years before, the police had found him in a parked car at 4:30 a.m. with a woman who was not his wife. Mr. FitzGerald, a former F.B.I. agent, said that nothing untoward had occurred. His campaign was further damaged by the news that he had been driving for years without a valid license. Mr. FitzGerald’s campaign never recovered, and Mr. Kasich enjoyed a double-digit lead in the two months leading up to the election. • Democrats in other races also suffer. Read More ▼ The weakness of the Democratic candidate for governor, Ed FitzGerald, appears to have hurt other hopefuls from the party further down the ballot in state races. Jon A. Husted, the Republican secretary of state, won his race against Nina Turner, a Democratic state senator from Cleveland who gained attention through numerous appearances as a commentator on MSNBC. Similarly, Mike DeWine, the incumbent attorney general, turned away the efforts of David Pepper, a Democrat. —JOHN SCHWARTZ Governor National Map » John Kasich has been called the winner of the race.
