The victory showcased his strength in Great Plains states and in the farm belt, as well as in states that held caucus contests. Sanders won victories in the two biggest cities: Omaha and Lincoln, winning a commanding victory in populous Douglas County.[1] He also swept most of the rural, mostly white and deeply conservative counties of the state, including those in the Nebraska Panhandle and the Rainwater basin which are among the most radically conservative areas of the nation.
