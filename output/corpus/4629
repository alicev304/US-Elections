Access Hollywood has aired nationally on various local stations, most of them affiliates of NBC, in the United States since September 9, 1996. It was previously produced by NBC Studios and has changed distributors over the years, first with New World/Genesis Distribution, then 20th Television (after News Corporation bought New World), followed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution who still distributes the show today via barter ad-sales, and then to NBC Enterprises when the network started up its own syndication division. Today, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, in association with NBC's owned-and-operated station KNBC has been solely responsible for its production and distribution since 2004. Warner Bros. continues its involvement with the program by having responsibilities for barter ad sales for Access Hollywood. On September 13, 2010, Access Hollywood began broadcasting in high definition.[1] On May 1, 2012, NBCUniversal Television Distribution announced it would renew Access Hollywood for three additional years through the 2014-15 season.[2] The program changed its name to simply Access on December 11, 2017.[3] On August 22, 2019, it was officially announced that Access and Access Live will receive an on-air refresh for their 24th and 10th seasons, respectively, with new names, logos, graphics and theme music, starting on September 9. Access returned to its original Access Hollywood name and begin airing live in the East Coast, with Access Live also rebranding as Access Daily. The program would also debut a second spin-off in the fall entitled All Access— which features long-form reports on true-crime and human interest stories and air initially on six NBC owned-and-operated stations. Former Extra host Mario Lopez also joined all three programs as co-host.[4] On-air staff[edit] Current on-air staff[edit] Anchors[edit] Kit Hoover – anchor (2010–present) Mario Lopez – anchor (2019–present) Scott Evans – anchor/weekend anchor (2019–present; previously served as senior correspondent from 2015—2019) Correspondents[edit] Zuri Hall - correspondent (2019—present) Sibley Scoles – weekend anchor/correspondent (2019–present) Tim Vincent – European correspondent (2005–present) Former on-air staff[edit] Michelle Beadle – correspondent (2012–2014; now at ESPN) Billy Bush – correspondent (2001–2004, anchor/voice over/executive producer (2004–2016; later at NBC's Today, now host of Extra) Steven "Cojo" Cojocaru – fashion correspondent (2000–2003, later at Entertainment Tonight) Giselle Fernández – weekday anchor/correspondent (1996–1999) Liz Hernandez - correspondent (2014–2017) Jill Martin - guest correspondent (2011–2013; now contributor on NBC News' weekday morning program: Today) Larry Mendte – weekday/weekend anchor (1996–1997, now a public-affairs host for two TV stations in the Northeast and a host at WABC radio) Maria Menounos – correspondent (2005–2011; later at Extra and E!

Access Across America[edit] In 2005, Access Hollywood went on a month-long roadtrip called Access Across America while the studio underwent a major overhaul. The show's new set was done in pastel colors with a modern flair, separating its look from other similar shows, including rival Entertainment Tonight. The new look also included a brand-new graphics package. Access Hollywood is taped at Studio 1 at The Burbank Studios (formerly NBC Studios) in Burbank, former home of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. Currently with Days of Our Lives, it was one of two remaining NBC-produced programs as of 2014 originating from Burbank; Access Hollywood moved to Universal City and Universal Studios Hollywood in 2015 as NBC's operations continue to combine in Universal City. Spin-offs[edit] The program has had some short-lived spinoffs in the last few years, including AMC Access for the AMC channel, and Real Access (the first teen-oriented entertainment news program, and the only attempt so far at an entertainment news program aimed at teens on television) for The N and Nickelodeon. The network most recently produced the African-American oriented TV One Access for the TV One cable channel. The programs formerly did entertainment segments for NBC's cable news channel titled Access MSNBC, though these have been withdrawn as MSNBC's news coverage has become mainly political.

The daytime talk show - currently hosted by Mario Lopez, Kit Hoover and Scott Evans, features entertainment news stories and in-studio guests. The program was initially seen only on NBC owned-and-operated stations in six markets[5] and Fox owned-and-operated stations in six other major markets,[6] all on stations that already carry the flagship series; since September 2011, the program also began being distributed to non-network owned stations that also carry the flagship series. The show airs live at 11:00am ET (8:00am in Los Angeles where the studios are located). The show changed its name to Access Live on December 11, 2017, and again to Access Daily on September 9, 2019. Access Daily was originally recorded at NBC Studios in Burbank, California; it currently broadcasts from 10 Universal City Plaza in Universal City, California, where it has been recorded since June 2015. On occasion, the program broadcasts shows on location outside Studio 1A on the Today plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City.

The United Kingdom version began in 2003 hosted by Kate Garraway and Vincent. There was a short-lived national version for the Republic of Ireland on the TV3 Group's defunct Channel 6 hosted by Jenny Buckley from 2006. Spoofs[edit] The show was parodied in the show Arthur in the special Arthur, It's Only Rock N' Roll when a spoof named Access Elwood interviewed the band U Stink. In the South Park episode "Free Hat", a show airs called "Excess Hollywood" with a look-alike of then host Pat O'Brien. The show is also parodied in the sitcom BoJack Horseman as "Excess Hollywood", later renamed to "Excess Hollywoo" after BoJack steals the D from the Hollywood Sign. Craig Ferguson often parodies Access Hollywood on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson in a segment called Access Extratainment Tonight (a portmanteau of Access Hollywood, Extra and Entertainment Tonight) with Ferguson as "Barney Slash".
