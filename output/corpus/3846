Endorsements are part of the "invisible primary" process, which occurs not only long before the general election in November 2016, but also largely occurs before even the caucuses and primaries have begun in February 2016. Early endorsements were correlated with the success candidates achieved in caucuses and primaries, for elections from 1980 through 2004.[1][2] (See the UCLA School of Political Parties.) Historically, there has been a correlation ("76% of the eventual vote percentage")[3] between the percentage of political endorsements from sitting and former elected officials earned by a Republican candidate in the first half of the year prior to a presidential election (for the purposes of this article, January–June, 2015), with the percentage of votes cast for that candidate in Republican primaries during the first half of the election year (i.e., January–June, 2016). The value of political endorsements varies, depending on whom they are from, when they are given, and other factors. Endorsements from politicians who live in states with early primaries are highly sought after.[4] So are endorsements from governors, federal senators, and federal representatives.[3] Endorsements from people from the candidate's home state are less valuable, unless multiple candidates from that state are running.[3] The impact of celebrity endorsements of political candidates is less clear, but can increase general election turnout,[5] or increase fundraising totals and media exposure.[6] Contents 1 Donald Trump (won presidency) 1.1 Donald Trump endorsements 2 Jeb Bush (withdrawn) 2.1 Jeb Bush endorsements 3 Ben Carson (withdrawn) 3.1 Ben Carson endorsements 4 Chris Christie (withdrawn) 4.1 Chris Christie endorsements 5 Ted Cruz (withdrawn) 5.1 Ted Cruz endorsements 6 Carly Fiorina (withdrawn) 6.1 Carly Fiorina endorsements 7 Jim Gilmore (withdrawn) 7.1 Jim Gilmore endorsements 8 Mike Huckabee (withdrawn) 8.1 Mike Huckabee endorsements 9 John Kasich (withdrawn) 9.1 John Kasich endorsements 10 Rand Paul (withdrawn) 10.1 Rand Paul endorsements 11 Marco Rubio (withdrawn) 11.1 Marco Rubio endorsements 12 Rick Santorum (withdrawn) 12.1 Rick Santorum endorsements 13 Lindsey Graham (withdrawn) 13.1 Lindsey Graham endorsements 14 Rick Perry (withdrawn) 14.1 Rick Perry endorsements 15 Bobby Jindal (withdrawn) 15.1 Bobby Jindal endorsements 16 Scott Walker (withdrawn) 16.1 Scott Walker endorsements 17 George Pataki (withdrawn) 17.1 George Pataki endorsements 18 Endorsement withholding 19 See also 20 References Donald Trump (won presidency)[edit] Main article: Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign Background: Donald Trump (born in New York in 1946 and raised there) is a real estate CEO (1971–present), with investments in New York, Florida, and several other states and countries.

George Pataki endorsements[edit] Main article: George Pataki 2016 presidential campaign § Endorsements Endorsement withholding[edit] The intentional withholding of an endorsement (aka "negative-endorsement") is a relevant and important category for this topic. At a minimum, it represents the loss of an endorsing entity for a candidate. It also represents the introduction of a minimum threshold. The editorial department of the Miami-based Sun-Sentinel on March 4, 2016, announced that it would endorse no GOP candidates as, "The kind of person who should be running is not in the race". [14] The Dallas News, after more than 75 years of endorsing Republicans, went the additional step of endorsing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.[15] See also[edit] Endorsements in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries References[edit] ^ Martin Cohen; David Karol; Hans Noel; John Zaller (2008).
