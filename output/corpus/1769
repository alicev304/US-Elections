coronavirus raise new question virus jump animal human animal jonathan epstein topic crucial since virus cause covid19 pandemic believe originate animal insight issue reach jonathan epstein veterinarian disease ecologist serve vice president science outreach ecohealth alliance nonprofit organization involve field laboratory research source coronavirus epstein chief science adviser smithsonian exhibit outbreak epidemic connected world display national museum natural history since 2018 cnn 4yearold female malayan tiger bronx zoo develop dry cough test positive coronavirus possible significance jonathan epstein confirm tiger case first evidence sars cov2 captive wildlife species big cat also suggest likely transmission person likely one animal care staff finding big cat zoo sign cough test provide important information disease might look like big cat also let zoo know happen within collection protect health animal collection probably good idea zoo staff start wear mask homemade scarce n95 work near animal enclosure read disease expert warn much yet know virus cause covid19 pandemic sars cov2 learn tremendous amount human epidemiological datum come us china every country similarly know little species may susceptible infection virus affect susceptible species recent study still yet peer review provide evidence domestic cat susceptible experimental infection sars cov2 cat sample wuhan outbreak start antibody sars cov2 suggest cat may infect owner covid19 cnn people concern pass covid19 pet risk get virus epstein currently evidence pet cat transmit transmit sars cov2 people clear covid19 pandemic drive humantohuman transmission however still lot know absence evidence person infect companion animal mean happen pet play important role life particularly face steep challenge best guidance right now us centers disease control prevention recommend people pet sick treat like family member avoid contact cnn coronavirus jump animal human epstein prior emergence sars coronavirus 2002 four known coronavirus human none cause significant illness mortality sars first known experience zoonotic pass animal people coronavirus though now know first four human coronavirus also originate animal one cause significant respiratory disease case fatality rate 9 comparison middle east respiratory syndrome mers coronavirus emerge 2012 case fatality rate around 35 still uncertainty case fatality rate covid19 truly know many infected tracking far 12 less severe sars mers much easily transmit among people queens master class fight compassion coronavirus large family virus many mammal bird strain often coronavirus stay within single species like sars mers now sars cov2 virus cause covid19 demonstrate ability infect several different animal species include human jump important question one remain unanswered term current outbreak know certain type bat call horseshoe bat natural reservoir sars related coronavirus weve find dozen closely related virus horseshoe bat china ability infect human virus general enter host cell hijack cell machinery make virus virus must attach specific part host cell call receptor inject genetic material rna case coronavirus host cell replication like lock key mechanism viruss key fit host lock bind enter cell cause infection sars cov sars cov2 use ace2 receptor find cell respiratory gi tract mammal include people still learn species susceptible sars cov2 know bat people ferret cat among keep cat indoors selfisolate limit spread coronavirus vet advise owner virus bind receptor find many species opportunity successfully jump natural reservoir population infect new host virus able adapt new host replicate efficiently transmit individual opportunity establish within new host half known human virus include hiv measles originally come animal reservoir since become endemic human population people bring various kind wildlife include bat domestic animal together wet market china create perfect opportunity virus like sars cov2 jump bat another animal people know coronavirus shed bat fece people animal expose bat fece bodily fluid wet market process handle butcher little attention pay handwashing clean space work become easy virus jump host donald trumps supreme challenge know sure sars cov2 emerge whether person directly infect contact bat whether animal involve either possible figure detail sars cov2 emerge vital make sure prevent additional spillover event virus still circulate bat hunt animal part market system risk second covid19 outbreak remain cnn study origin sars epidemic help trace horseshoe bat explain establish epstein 2004 part international team include colleague ecohealth alliance partner china australia goal identify wildlife reservoir sars coronavirus originally suspect source civet virus isolate civet people sell market study chinese research group come year outbreak show wild farmed civet outside market guangdong evidence current past infection sar suggest civet become infected market just like people mean another animal likely reservoir virus focus bat possible source commonly eat sell widely market time also multiple cluster sars case early different part guangdong apparently unrelated make sense animal common widely distribute like bat rodent responsible independent infection different location catch test bat wild well find wet market several province include guangdong sample multiple species ultimately find virus closely related sars four different species horseshoe bat get free weekly newsletter sign cnn opinion new newsletter join twitter facebook virus find identical sars look family tree coronavirus appear direct ancestor meaning sars evolve virus first clue sars come bat issue face virus find 92 identical sars act like sars use ace2 receptor sars enter cell theoretically infected people civet also cause respiratory disease lab animal experiment way sars year continuous research look coronavirus horseshoe bat china finally find virus genetically closer sars use ace2 receptor lab able infect human lung tissue cell suggest virus capable direct battohuman transmission finding provide strongest evidence date sars come horseshoe bat cnn know origin covid19 epstein base body research group identify virus yunan province horseshoe bat 96 similar across entire genome sars cov2 closest relative know virus cause covid19 find type bat carry sarsrelated coronavirus give confidence sars cov2 like sars bat virus however still sure exactly virus get bat people cnn lessen chance future disease pass animal people epstein weve scratch surface identify diversity virus circulate animal clearly coronavirus important group scientific community surprise emergence yet another zoonotic sarslike coronavirus now third since 2002 will likely see unless significantly change way interact wildlife now pretty good understanding part world likely experience outbreak unrecognized zoonotic virus also know zoonotic disease outbreak drive human activity bring livestock frequent contact wildlife tiger bronx zoo test positive coronavirus activity concern include land use change deforestation urbanization agricultural land conversion intensive livestock production without sufficient separation livestock wildlife wildlife trade include bring live wildlife market mix domestic animal people fortunately thing reduce risk zoonotic virus emerge continue support research surveillance effort identify virus bat key wildlife group eg rodent primate order better understand nature may potential cause disease people livestock invest strengthen public health surveillance system globally specifically emerge disease hotspot outbreak anywhere threat everywhere weve see covid19 country need able identify known new virus cause disease livestock people rapidly respond outbreak small contain outbreak anywhere threat everywhere jonathan epstein require build skilled workforce work across human animal health sector use call one health approach also require investment laboratory capacity lab able quickly identify characterize new virus emerge continue identify highrisk activity environment wildlife market livestock farming system allow domestic animal comingle wildlife provide opportunity virus jump wildlife animal people identify modify eliminate riskiest environment will probably protect virus know unseen enemy pandemic cnn film documentary explore disease like zika ebola influenza spread watch now cnngo risk reduction also begin community engagement research local social scientist best understanding local custom cultural context will vital develop realistic strategy change high risk behavior legislation necessary alone insufficient make activity illegal drive underground make harder monitor recognize go prevent every spillover event will continue zoonotic disease outbreak take pandemic prevention seriously money require fraction covid19 will end cost
