We accept submissions for short, interactive and virtual reality documentaries by both renowned and emerging independent filmmakers and artists. Read more about Op-Docs » We will consider written pitches that include links to representative footage, as well as completed videos. We cannot consider film trailers, nor can we consider videos that have already been posted online or broadcast on television. In addition to new short works, we can consider pieces that are adapted from longer, topical works-in-progress. Op-Docs are generally 5-10 minutes in length. Please submit Op-Doc pitches through this form. To contact Op-Docs, email opinion.video@nytimes.com. Can't find what you're looking for?
