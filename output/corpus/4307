She relied on turnout in larger cities, including Hartford (which she won 51-47), New Haven, and Bridgeport.[9] She managed a large win in Greenwich, bolstered by support from more affluent Democrats[10] and won in the New York City suburbs as a whole 59-40. Sanders held Clinton to a narrow margin statewide, thanks to his support in rural areas which he won 63-37.[11] In terms of demographics, Clinton won the African American vote 69-30, older voters 62-35, and the votes of women 57-41. Clinton also won women with children 55-44, and women without children 58-40. Sanders won the youth vote by an overwhelming margin of 66-34, the votes of men 55-43, and won the Caucasian vote (74% of the electorate) by a narrow 50-48 margin. Sanders won among voters with an income of less than 50k and 100k, with Clinton winning more affluent voters.[12] In terms of political ideology, Clinton won liberals 52-48 and moderates/conservatives 53-43. Clinton won Democrats 60-39 but lost self-identified independents to Sanders 74-23. Clinton's stance on gun control resonated with voters in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School Shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.[13] References[edit] ^ "Connecticut Secretary of State - Official Primary Results" (PDF).
