The 2016 United States presidential election in Florida was won by Donald Trump on November 8, 2016, with a plurality of 49.0% of the popular vote that included a 1.2% winning margin over Hillary Clinton, who had 47.8% of the vote. On March 15, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Florida voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, America's Party, Constitution, and Socialism and Liberation parties' respective nominees for president (Green on July 31). Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated weren't able to vote in any primaries. Florida is a winner-take-all voting state for Republicans, but is a proportional voting state for Democrats.

It was broadcast through a partnership between Univision and The Washington Post.[5][6] The debate was discussed during a job interview conducted in early 2015 between the Democratic National Committee's then-Communications Director Mo Elleithee and future Hispanic Media Director Pablo Manriquez. After starting at the DNC in April 2015, Manriquez "talked about the idea for a debate for Democratic candidates on Univision to anyone who had ears to listen."[7] The debate was officially announced on November 2, 2015.[8] Opinion polling[edit] See also: Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries § Florida Results[edit] Election results by county.

The candidates debated at the University of Miami, moderated by Jake Tapper and questioned by CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, Salem Radio Network talk-show host Hugh Hewitt, and Washington Times contributor Stephen Dinan. The Washington Times cohosted the debate.[10] The debate was originally scheduled considering the likelihood that no candidate would clinch the Republican nomination before March 15, due to the overall size of the field.[11] On the day of the debate, CNN summarized the immediate stakes: "This debate comes just five days ahead of 'Super Tuesday 3', when more than 350 delegates are decided, including winner-take-all contests in Florida and Ohio. Both Trump and Rubio are predicting [a win in] Florida. For Trump, a win here would fuel his growing momentum and further grow his delegate lead; for Rubio, losing his home state could be the death knell for his campaign."[12] This was the twelfth and final debate appearance of Rubio, who suspended his campaign on March 15.[13] Results[edit] Election results by county.
