"Third party" is a term commonly used in the United States in reference to political parties other than the two major parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. An independent candidate is one who runs for office with no formal party affiliation. Ballot access in states holding 270 or more electoral votes represents a majority of the 538 electoral votes in the Electoral College. The number of electoral votes for which a party or independent candidate has secured ballot access may increase as those parties or candidates complete their petitions, and filings for ballot access, until September 2016 when the last petition deadlines occur.[1] According to the Green Papers website, 31 people were on the ballot in at least one state, while 192, including those who were on ballots in some states, obtained recognition as official "write-in" candidates.[2] Contents 1 Summary 2 Candidates 2.1 Gary Johnson, Libertarian Party 2.1.1 Poll standings 2.1.2 Party nomination contest 2.2 Jill Stein, Green Party 2.2.1 Poll standings 2.2.2 Party nomination contest 2.3 Evan McMullin, Better for America Group and others 2.4 Darrell Castle, Constitution Party 2.4.1 Poll standings 2.4.2 Nomination contest 2.5 Gloria La Riva, multiple parties 2.5.1 Party for Socialism and Liberation 2.5.2 Liberty Union Party (Vermont) 2.5.3 Peace and Freedom Party 2.6 Rocky De La Fuente, American Delta and Reform Parties, plus others 2.6.1 Poll standings 2.6.2 American Delta party nomination 2.6.3 Reform party nomination 2.7 Richard Duncan, Independent 2.8 Bernie Sanders 2.9 Dan Vacek, Legal Marijuana Now Party 2.10 Alyson Kennedy, Socialist Workers Party 2.11 Chris Keniston, Veterans Party of America 2.12 Mike Maturen, American Solidarity Party 2.13 James Hedges, Prohibition Party 2.14 Tom Hoefling, America's Party 2.15 Monica Moorehead, Workers World Party 2.16 Peter Skewes, American Party (South Carolina) 2.17 Laurence Kotlikoff, Independent 2.18 Rocky Giordani, Independent American Party 2.19 Emidio "Mimi" Soltysik, Socialist Party USA 2.20 Rod Silva, Nutrition Party 2.21 Jerry White, Socialist Equality Party 3 Other candidate considerations 3.1 American Independent and other fusion tickets 3.1.1 Conservative party nomination in New York 3.1.2 Working Families party nomination in New York 3.1.3 Woman's Equality party nomination in New York 3.1.4 American Independent Party nomination in California 3.2 No ballot access 3.3 Write-in candidates 3.3.1 Non-notable candidates 3.4 Previously speculated 3.5 Withdrew 3.6 Declined 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Summary[edit] 2016 U.S. Presidential Election Results[3] for candidates that got at least 1000 votes or were on at least one state ballot State Hillary Clinton Donald Trump Gary Johnson Jill Stein Evan McMullin Darrell Castle Bernie Sanders Gloria La Riva Rocky De La Fuente Richard Duncan Dan Vacek Alyson Kennedy Mike Smith Chris Keniston Mike Maturen Lynn Kahn James Hedges Tom Hoefling Monica Moorehead Emidio Soltysik L.

Richard Duncan Ohio Ricky Johnson 24,308 (0%) 18 (173) Ohio[124] (Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia) Bernie Sanders[edit] Sanders campaigning for Hillary Clinton at Nashua Community College in October 2016. Several grassroots campaigns to elect Bernie Sanders President as a write-in candidate were established on social media in the run-up to the United States presidential election. Though Sanders continued to campaign for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, supporters pointed to alleged DNC bias in the Democratic Party's presidential primaries against Sanders, and Clinton's email scandal, and continued to support him.[125] Both Clinton and Donald Trump would have had to win less than the required 270 electoral college votes for Sanders to have denied either candidate the presidency, and for the election to be passed to the House of Representatives - thus the initial write-in campaign around Vermont, offering only 3 electoral college votes, was unsuccessful.[126] The campaign expanded to include all 12 eligible states (one of which listed Sanders as an official write-in candidate), and relied on states such as California, with a high electoral college vote count and large support for Sanders, to be successful in denying both Trump and Clinton.[127] He has received over 100 thousand popular votes and one electoral vote. Two other electoral votes were disallowed. Notably, he came in third in Vermont,[56] coming ahead of both Gary Johnson and Jill Stein and taking 5.7% of the vote (18,183 tallied), something that has never happened before in a fall Presidential election.

Other candidate considerations[edit] American Independent and other fusion tickets[edit] Several states, most notably New York, permit fusion tickets. A fusion ticket is when a candidate or candidates are permitted more than one ballot line by being nominated by one or more third parties and permitting the votes on all lines to be added together for a single state total. The Clinton/Kaine ticket was on the ballot in New York on the Women's Equality and Working Families Party lines, while the Trump/Pence ticket was on the Conservative party there as well as the American Independent Party in California. Conservative party nomination in New York[edit] The state committee nominated Donald Trump by voice vote. Total popular vote: 271,961 (3.8%) Working Families party nomination in New York[edit] Initially, the Working Families Party had endorsed Bernie Sanders for president, but when he conceded defeat at the Democratic convention and endorsed Hillary Clinton, the party had a mail in primary where Clinton defeated Jill Stein and "no endorsement" with 68% of the vote, preferring fusion rather than "asking voters to cast a vote that is at best meaningless and at worst destructive of progressive possibility."[194] Total popular vote: 130,245 (1.8%) Woman's Equality party nomination in New York[edit] A faction of the party's executive committee nominated Dr. Lynn Sandra Kahn, while another nominated Hillary Clinton. The New York State board of elections decided the former Secretary of State would get the ballot line.[195][196] Total popular vote: 32,307 (0.5%) American Independent Party nomination in California[edit] Further information: American Independent Party The state committee ignored the primary and designated Trump as its nominee.[197] California did not record a separate ballot total for the AIP.

Write-in candidates[edit] A minimum of 1,022,439 (0.8%) voters[222] cast write in ballots, what is believed to be a record. Many were for registered candidates who were on the ballot in one or more states, others for candidates who were registered but were on no ballots and others were for fictional or perceptibly humorous figures, like of Mickey Mouse or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The vast majority of these will never be counted or recorded as individuals but as "Others" or "Scattered." Many states disallow write-in candidacies.[223] Non-notable candidates[edit] The following candidates had no on-ballot access but were official write-in candidates in at least one state.[224] Alabama, Iowa, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Vermont are not listed below as those states do not require filing as a write-in candidate.
