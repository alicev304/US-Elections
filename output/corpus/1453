Help Category:Articles with French-language sources (fr) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This is a tracking categoryIt is used to build and maintain lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme. More information: This category is hidden on its member pages—unless the corresponding user preference is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications). Administrators: Please do not delete this category even if it is empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This is a tracking category for articles that use {{in lang|fr}} to identify French-language sources.
