West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming What You Can Do Experts’ understanding of how the virus spreads is still limited, but there are four factors that most likely play a role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. If your community is affected, you can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by following some basic steps: Wash your hands! Scrub with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and then dry them with a clean towel or let them air dry. Keep distance from sick people. Try to stay six feet away from anybody showing flu- or cold-like symptoms, and don’t go to work if you’re sick. Prepare your family, and communicate your plan about evacuations, resources and supplies. Experts suggest stocking at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. Consider doing the same for food staples, laundry detergent and diapers, if you have small children. Here’s a complete guide on how you can prepare for the coronavirus outbreak. Note: Data are based on reports by states and counties at the time of publication. Local governments may revise reported numbers as they get new information. Some deaths may be reported by officials in two different jurisdictions. When possible, deaths have been reported here in the jurisdiction where the death occurred. While the first known case in the United States was announced on Jan. 21, charts show cases since Feb. 26, when American public health officials first identified community transmission of the virus.
