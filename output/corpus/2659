Created in 1997, the DFC Program provides grants to community coalitions to strengthen the infrastructure among local partners to create and sustain a reduction in local youth substance use. Recognizing that local problems need local solutions, DFC-funded coalitions engage multiple sectors of the community and employ a variety of environmental strategies to address local substance use problems. DFCs involve local communities in finding solutions and also helps youth at risk for substance use recognize the majority of our Nation’s youth choose not to use substances. As demonstrated by independent evaluations, the DFC Support Program significantly reduces substance use amongst the target population. DFC Coalitions are made up of community leaders representing twelve sectors that organize to meet the local prevention needs of the youth and families in their communities. These twelve sectors are: Youth Parents Businesses Media School Youth-serving organizations Law enforcement Religious/fraternal organizations Civic and volunteer organizations Healthcare professionals State, Local, and Tribal governments Other organizations involved in reducing illicit substance use By funding these coalitions, the DFC Support program ensures communities adopt a balanced and comprehensive approach to reducing substance abuse in their neighborhoods.
