Today, the President signed legislation that makes critical investments in our military, our veterans, and our Nation’s infrastructure. This signals to our veterans, men and women in uniform and their families that the Nation stands behind them as they risk everything to protect our freedoms as Americans. The Administration worked closely with Congress to deliver historic funding levels for the Department of Veterans Affairs, modernize the VA health record system, provide new homes for military families, and invest in a strong national nuclear security strategy. It is evident that President Trump continues to keep his promises to prioritize our nation’s heroes while protecting hardworking American taxpayers.” The White House Live Jobs Get Involved Copyright Policy Privacy Policy Twitter Facebook Instagram Contact News Remarks Briefings & Statements Presidential Actions Articles All News Issues Education National Security & Defense Budget & Spending Immigration Healthcare All Issues The Administration President Donald J.
