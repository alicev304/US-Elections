They find Steele at his lawyer's office, but the lawyer refuses to let them meet with Steele.[8][9][10][11] On CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, Whitaker, whom Trump will appoint acting AG in November 2018, says, "So I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt."[12] Early July: In response to queries from Politico about assertions made by Peter W. Smith in November 2016, WikiLeaks denies it has been in possession of Clinton's deleted 30,000 emails since February 2016. WikiLeaks also declines to say whether Smith was in contact with the group.[13] Trump asks White House staff secretary Rob Porter to find out whether Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would be interested in taking over responsibility for the Mueller investigation and eventually replacing Sessions as Attorney General. Porter ignores Trump's request because he is concerned about the implications of being involved in ending the investigation or firing Mueller.[14]:107-108 July 7: During a two-hour meeting with Trump at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit, Putin denies interfering in the 2016 US election. Trump conducts a second meeting with Putin some hours later, with no US aides. The second meeting is undisclosed by the White House until July 18, following news reports.[15][16][17][18] Trump takes his translator's notes and orders the translator not to discuss the meeting with other administration officials.[19] Concerns about violations of the Presidential Records Act are later raised. Hicks and White House communications advisor Josh Raffel learn that The New York Times is working on a story about the Trump Tower meeting.[14]:101 July 8: Returning from Germany aboard Air Force One, Trump preemptively dictates a misleading statement on behalf of Trump Jr., claiming that the Veselnitskaya meeting on June 9, 2016 concerned child adoption.[20][21][22][14]:101-103 Without permission from Trump, Trump's legal team spokesman Mark Corallo works with Circa News to publish a story[23] about the Trump Tower meeting that casts it as possibly being part of "a broader election opposition effort to smear [Trump] by creating the impression he and his family had extensive ties to Russia as the Kremlin was interfering in the 2016 election."[14]:103-104 July 9: The New York Times first reports that Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort met Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016.[24][25] In response to the report, Goldstone sends Emin Agalarov a text message stating that he kept Emin's father out of the story, and warns that it could blow up.[26]:121 The Circa News story is published an hour later.[14]:103-104 Trump and Hicks chastise Corallo for his participation in the Circa News story.[14]:104 President Trump says he and Putin "discussed forming an impenetrable cyber security unit so that election hacking, and many other negative things, will be guarded and safe." Trump later says he does not think this will happen.[27] July 10 Trump, Hicks, and Corallo have a conference call to discuss the handling of the Veselnitskaya meeting revelations. Corallo says the statement drafted on Air Force One will backfire because the original emails will eventually come out. Hicks responds the emails "will never get out." Corallo resigns shortly thereafter, reportedly due to concerns over possible obstruction of justice.[28] Trump Organization lawyers email Rob Goldstone and two others a prepared statement drafted in Goldstone's name to use as a response to inquires about the Trump Tower meeting. The statement supports Trump Jr.'s account of the meeting.[29][26]:122 Goldstone responds with his own version of the statement that says he was acting on behalf of Emin Agalarov and that the meeting was about DNC funding from Russia, but never uses either statement.[26]:122 Of the Trump Tower meeting, Whitaker says, "But if you have somebody that you trust that is saying you need to meet with this individual because they have information about your opponent, you would take that meeting. There is no suggestion that at the time Donald Trump Jr. knew..."[30] July 10–18: Further details about the Veselnitskaya meeting emerge in the press.[31][32][33] Sekulow repeatedly denies that Trump was involved in drafting Trump Jr's statement.[34][14]:104-105 July 11: Trump Jr. tweets his emails about the Trump Tower meeting before The New York Times publishes them minutes later.[35][36] July 12: Two Democratic Party donors and a former party staff member file an invasion of privacy lawsuit against Trump’s campaign and Stone.[37] Articles of Impeachment against President Trump are formally filed in the House of Representatives.[38] Speaking on Fox News, Pence's spokesman Marc Lotter repeatedly refuses to clarify whether or not Pence met with Russian representatives.[39][40] Rohrabacher removes a photo of himself and Nigel Farage from Facebook after a journalist posts it on Twitter.[41][42] CNN reports that multiple DNC officials and former Clinton campaign officials deny working with Ukraine to find dirt on Trump and his associates. DNC research director Lauren Dillon says, "I've been director of research at the DNC for four years and had zero contact with foreign governments." The denials are in response to claims by White House officials that Alexandra Chalupa worked with the Ukrainian embassy to smear Manafort.[43] Mueller's team interviews translator Anatoli Samochornov for the first of two times.[26]:117, 119[14]:99 Mueller's team interviews security expert Eric York for the first of three times.[26]:63[44] July 13: Mueller's team interviews Samochornov for the second of two times.[26]:117-118, 123 Mueller's team interviews security expert Eric York for the second of three times.[26]:63[44] July 14: Brad Parscale, the digital media director of Trump's campaign, issues a statement stating "I am unaware of any Russian involvement in the digital and data operation of the 2016 Trump presidential campaign" after accepting an invitation to testify before the House Intelligence Committee.[45] July 17: Mueller's team interviews former Acting Assistant Attorney General Mary McCord.[14]:26, 30-31 Michael Cohen search warrants July 18: Mueller obtains a search warrant for Michael Cohen's Gmail account.[46][47] July 19: The New York Times reports on offshore transactions and shell companies linked to Manafort's work in Ukraine and investments with a Russian oligarch.[48] The New York Times reports on sources claiming that Deutsche Bank is cooperating with federal investigators about Trump accounts.[49] Trump follows-up with Lewandowski about the June 19 public statement he dictated for Sessions to read. Trump tells Lewandowski to inform Sessions that he will be fired if he doesn't meet with Lewandowski. After the meeting, Lewandowski passes the statement to Dearborn and asks him to deliver it to Sessions. Feeling uncomfortable about being the messenger, Dearborn ignores the request and does not deliver the message.[14]:92-93 Trump, in an unscheduled interview with The New York Times, blasts Sessions for recusing himself without telling Trump in advance of his nomination to be Attorney General.[50][51] Trump then threatens Mueller's job if the investigation expands to his personal finances.[50][51] He tells the Times that he "didn't know about the [Trump Tower] meeting" at the time and adds, "As I've said—most other people, you know, when they call up and say, 'By the way, we have information on your opponent,' I think most politicians—I was just with a lot of people, they said, ... 'Who wouldn't have taken a meeting like that?'"[50][14]:105 Hicks repeatedly tries to stop the interview to no avail.[14]:93 The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) says it has never certified Kaspersky Lab's security software, an admission that comes just a week after the Trump administration booted the firm from two of its approved suppliers lists.[52] July 20: Bloomberg News reports that Mueller is investigating Trump's business transactions.[53] The Washington Post reports Trump is asking his attorneys about his ability to pardon himself and other key aides and family members.[54] Paul Behrends is removed from his position as staff director for a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee chaired by Rohrabacher. The move comes after news reports about Behrends's and Rohrbacher's trip to Moscow in April 2016.[55] Senator Chuck Grassley sends the Justice Department a letter calling for an investigation into alleged coordination between Chalupa and the Ukrainian government to interfere in the 2016 election. He cites the January 11 Politico report on alleged Ukrainian interference as evidence.[56][57] Mueller's team interviews Yates's top deputy Matthew S. Axelrod.[14]:30[58] July 21: The Washington Post reports Sessions discussed Trump campaign-related matters with Kislyak.[59] The Senate Judiciary Committee requests all communications between Trump Jr. and a group of people, including Jill Stein. She publicly describes the notion that she communicated with Trump Jr. as "an obvious smear designed to generate a fake news feeding frenzy".[60] John M. Dowd replaces Marc Kasowitz at the head of Trump's legal team, following personal threats made by Kasowitz.[61] Legal spokesman Mark Corallo resigns.[62] Michael Wolff later reports that Corallo had been instructed not to speak to the press or to answer his telephone, and that he privately stated his belief that the Air Force One meeting on July 8, 2017 represented likely obstruction of justice.[63] A complaint is filed against Representative Dana Rohrabacher with the Office of Foreign Assets Control alleging violations of Magnitsky Act sanctions.[64][65] In April 2016, Rohrabacher received a document directly from Russian Deputy Prosecutor Viktor Grin, an individual under sanctions, and used it in attempts to weaken the Magnitsky Act.[66] The allegation is that the work Rohrabacher performed was a "service" provided to Grin in violation of the sanctions against Grin.[64] Priebus calls Hunt in the evening to discuss whether Sessions will be fired or resign in the wake of the Washington Post article. Hunt tells him that Sessions has no intentions of resigning. She points out that Trump will still be under investigation without Sessions.[14]:94-95 July 22: Trump asserts "complete power" to pardon anyone in relation to the Russia investigation.[67] Trump orders Priebus to tell Sessions that he has "no choice" and "must immediately resign." Priebus then calls McGahn for advice. McGahn tells him to ignore Trump's order, and the two discuss the possibility of resigining instead of carrying out Trump's order to fire Sessions. When Trump follows-up with Priebus in the afternoon, Priebus tells him he will get Sessions to resign. Trmp follows-up again. Priebus convinces him to hold off on the resignation because Rosenstien and Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand would also resign and Trump would probably never get another Attorney General confirmed by Congress.[14]:95-96 July 24: After a closed-door meeting with the Senate Intelligence Committee, Kushner issues a statement denying any collusion with Russian officials.[68][69] July 25: Kushner meets with the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door meeting.[70][69] Manafort meets with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and turns over contemporaneous notes of the June 9, 2016 meeting.[71][72] In an Oval Office interview with The Wall Street Journal's Gerard Baker, Trump states that there was "nobody on the campaign that saw anybody from Russia".[73] July 26: The FBI conducts a predawn raid on Manafort's home, seizing documents and electronic devices.[71][74] The raid happens on the day Manafort was scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[75] July 27: Papadopoulos is arrested upon arrival at Washington Dulles International Airport.[76] July 28: Trump indicates his intention to sign the bill passed by overwhelming veto-proof majorities in both houses of Congress taking the sanctions in place against Russia out of the president's control.[77][78] July 30: Putin, responding to sanctions, orders a cut in U.S. diplomatic staff by 755, and bars U.S. officials from entering a warehouse in Moscow used by the United States Embassy and to a site along the Moscow River.[79] July 31: The Washington Post reports that Trump personally dictated a statement for Donald Trump Jr. stating that the Veselnitskaya meeting “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children”.[20] Late July: Mueller removes senior FBI investigator Peter Strzok from his team following the discovery of private texts exchanged with FBI lawyer Lisa Page during the Clinton investigation and the election campaign. According to The Washington Post, the texts contain pro-Clinton comments, are critical of Congress and the media, and call Trump an "idiot" and a "loathsome human".[80][81][82] August[edit] August 1 The Washington Post reports that Rod Wheeler has filed a lawsuit claiming the Trump White House was directly involved in the publication of a Fox News story about the Seth Rich conspiracy theory.[83] White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders comments[84] on The Washington Post article from the day before claiming Trump dictated the response about the Trump Tower meeting. She clarifies that Trump "certainly didn't dictate, ... but he weighed in, offered suggestion, like any father would do, based on the limited information that he had."[85][14]:105 August 2: Trump signs the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), legislation limiting his ability to ease sanctions against Russia.

Kramer testifies before the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session about his role in bringing the Steele dossier to the FBI.[467] December 20: Mark Warner delivers a speech to the Senate warning Trump of "immediate and significant consequences" should he attempt to dismiss Mueller or to pardon those involved in the investigation.[468] Foreign Policy reports that records submitted to Mueller's team indicate that McGahn researched federal law related both to the Logan Act and making false statements to investigators in the early days of Trump's presidency and that he may have warned Trump that Flynn was in potential violation.[469] Reports emerge that a group headed by Nunes has spent several weeks compiling a report on alleged "corruption and conspiracy in the upper ranks of federal law enforcement".[436] In private testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this week, McCabe tells lawmakers that Comey informed him of conversations he had with Trump soon after they happened.[470] Felix Sater is interviewed in New York by Congressional staff.[471] December 22: The New York Times reports that federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York have sought records from Deutsche Bank about entities associated with Kushner's family businesses.[472] The prosecutors are examining a $285 million loan Deutsche Bank made one month before Election Day to lease 229 West 43rd Street, the former New York Times building in Times Square.[473] Journalist David Corn, the first to report the existence of the Steele dossier, denies that FBI General Counsel James Baker was his source, following Baker's reassignment.[474] Mueller's team interviews McFarland the final of three times.[26]:142, 169-172[14]:25-26, 29, 42-44, 121 December 23: Kramer's lawyer, Larry Robbins, sends a letter to the House Intelligence Committee informing them they have a leak. He tells them that after his client testified before the committee on December 19, Cohen's lawyer Stephen Ryan contacted Robbins because someone from the House told him that Kramer has information that could help Cohen. Robbins says he declined Ryan's request for help.[467][475] December 24: The Guardian reports that the FBI has asked the Central Bank of Cyprus for financial information about the defunct FBME Bank, which was used by wealthy Russians with political connections and has been accused by the US government of money laundering.[476] Bloomberg reports that the Russia-related investigation into FBME was connected to a flow of illegal Russian funds into the New York real estate market.[477] December 27: According to The Washington Post, Trump’s legal team plans to cast Flynn as a "liar seeking to protect himself" if he accuses Trump or his senior aides of any wrongdoing.[478] Investigative journalist Michael Isikoff reports that Mueller has begun questioning RNC staffers about the party's digital operation that worked with the Trump campaign to target voters in key swing states.[479][480] Kramer receives a subpoena to make a second appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. Ten minutes later, conservative media report that the committee issued a subpoena to Kramer to appear in January.[475] December 28: When questioned about his plans regarding the Mueller probe in a New York Times interview with Michael S. Schmidt, Trump says, "I have absolute right to do what I want to do with the Justice Department."[481] 2018[edit] Main articles: Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (January–June 2018) and Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (July–December 2018) Further information: Timeline of the presidency of Donald Trump See also[edit] Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections Business projects of Donald Trump in Russia Criminal charges brought in the Special Counsel investigation (2017–2019) Cyberwarfare by Russia Donald Trump's disclosures of classified information Efforts to impeach Donald Trump Foreign electoral intervention Propaganda in post-Soviet Russia Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum#Timeline Social media in the United States presidential election, 2016 References[edit] ^ Abramson, Seth (November 13, 2018).
