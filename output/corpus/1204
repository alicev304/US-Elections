Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation - 2012
The Green Papers Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation - 2012 Reference: "The Rules of the Republican Party" adopted by the RNC 1 September 2008: http://www.gop.com/images/legal/2008_RULES_Adopted.pdf. Timing Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada may begin their delegate selection primaries, caucuses, and conventions on Wednesday 1 February 2012. All other jurisdictions may begin their processes on the Tuesday 6 March 2012 [Rule 15(b)(1)]. All processes must be completed no later than 23 July 2012, 35 days before the National Convention [Rule 19(a)]. The computations used to create this document are described in the "The Rules of the Republican Party" adopted during the 2008 Republican National Convention. Republicans base delegates are determined by the number of U.S. Senators and U.S. House Members elected by each state. Bonus delegates are awarded based on the number of party members elected as Presidential Electors (in 2008), Governors (2008-2011), House members (2008-2011), Senators (2006-2011), and state legislatures (2008-2011). Delegate Allocation For Jurisdictions with Constitutionally Elected Members of Congress: 10 At-Large delegates from each state, that is, 5 at-large delegates for each U.S. Senator [Rule 13(a)(1)]. 3 District delegates for each U.S. Representative as established by the 2010 census [Rule 13(a)(3)]. For Jurisdictions without Constitutionally Elected Members of Congress [Rule 13(a)(4)]: 6 at-large delegates from American Samoa. 16 at-large delegates from the District of Columbia. 6 at-large delegates from Guam. 6 at-large delegates from the Northern Mariana Islands. 20 at-large delegates from Puerto Rico. 6 at-large delegates from Virgin Islands. For all Jurisdictions - 3 party leaders: the national committeeman, the national committee woman, and the chairman of the state Republican Party. [Rule 13(a)(2)] Bonus Delegates President: States casting a majority of their 2008 Electoral Votes for the Republican Candidate receive 4.5 + 0.60 � the Jurisdiction's Total 2012 Electoral Vote in bonus delegates. Should the District of Columbia cast the majority of their electoral votes for the Republican Candidate, the District will receive 4.5 + (0.30 � 16) in bonus delegates. Round any fractions UP to the next whole number. [Rules 13(a)(5) and 13(a)(7)] U.S. Senate: Award 1 bonus delegate for each Republican Senator elected in the 6 year period between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011. Limit 2. [Rule 13(a)(6)] Governor States electing a Republican Governor between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 receive 1 bonus delegate. Limit: 1. [Rule 13(a)(5)(i)] U.S. House: States electing Republicans to 50% or more of their U.S. House seats between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 receive 1 bonus delegate. Limit 1. [Rule 13(a)(5)(ii)] One Chamber: States electing a Republican majority to one chamber of the state legislature (OR the legislature is presided over by a Republican) between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 receive 1 bonus delegate. Limit 1. [Rule 13(a)(5)(iii)] All Chambers: States electing a Republican majority to all chambers of the state legislature (OR all chambers are presided over by a Republican) between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2011 receive 1 bonus delegate. Limit 1. [Rule 13(a)(5)(iv)] [Rule 13 Membership in Convention] Notes: Nebraska split its 2008 electoral vote awarding 4 votes to McCain and 1 vote to Obama. Since McCain received a majority of the state's 5 electoral votes, Nebraska receives 4.5 + (60% of 5 electoral votes) = 4.5 + 3.0 = 7.5 bonus delegates. Rounded up = 8 Presidential bonus delegates. Proportional Allocation to Presidential Contenders Prior to 1 April 2012, any presidential primary, caucus, convention, or other meeting to select National Convention delegates shall allocate delegates on a proportional basis. [Rule 15(b)(2) A table listing the 2008 allocation method used by each state is here. � Sanctions No primary, caucus, or convention to elect, select, allocate, or bind delegates to the national convention shall occur prior to Tuesday 6 March 2012 .... Except Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Nevada may begin their processes at any time on or after 1 February 2012) ... [Rule 15(b)] If a state party violates the timing rules before the 1st day of the month in which the state is authorized to begin their process, the number of delegates from that state is reduced by 50%. When computing the revised number of delegates, multiply the number of pre-penalty delegates by 0.5 then round any fractions UP to the next whole number. No member of the Republican National Committee from the offending state is permitted to serve as a delegate or alternate to the national convention. No delegation can be reduced to less than 2 delegates. [Rule 16(a), 16(e)(1)] . There is no appeal from either a finding of a violation or an imposed penalty. [Rule 16(f)]. A table listing the estimated start date for each state is here. 2008 note: Florida, Michigan, New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Wyoming received a 50% penalty for violating the timing rule.
