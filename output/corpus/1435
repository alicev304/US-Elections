1973 United States vice presidential confirmation - Wikipedia
1973 United States vice presidential confirmation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search House Minority Leader Gerald Ford was chosen as the 40th Vice President of the United States in 1973. In 1973, Republican Vice President Spiro Agnew was forced to resign following a controversy over his personal taxes. Under the terms of the 25th Amendment, a vice presidential vacancy is filled when the president nominates a candidate who is confirmed by both houses of Congress. Republican President Richard Nixon thus had the task of selecting a vice president who could receive the majority support of both houses of Congress, which were controlled by the Democrats. President Nixon considered selecting former Texas Governor John Connally, New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, and California Governor Ronald Reagan.[1] However, Nixon settled on House Minority Leader Gerald Ford of Michigan, a moderate Republican who was popular among the members of Congress and who was good friends with Nixon.[1] Ford won the approval of both houses by huge margins, and was sworn in as the 40th Vice President of the United States on December 6, 1973.[1][2] In 1974, Ford ascended to the presidency after the Watergate scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon. Confirmation votes[edit] By a vote of 92 to 3 on November 27, 1973, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Gerald Ford.[3] One week later, on December 6, the House of Representatives gave its approval, 387 to 35.[4] 1973 U.S. Senate Vice presidential confirmation vote: Party Total votes Democratic Republican Conservative Independent Yes 51 39 1 1 92 (96.8%) No 3 0 0 0 3 (3.2%) Result: Confirmed 1973 U.S. House Vice presidential confirmation vote: Party Total votes Democratic Republican Yes 199 188 387 (91.7%) No 35 0 35 (8.3%) Result: Confirmed References[edit] ^ a b c Mieczkowski, Yanek (22 April 2005).
