Because of the large number of articles involved, full navigation is split among several navboxes: {{Donald Trump}} as a generic presidential biography template {{Trump businesses}} focusing on Trump's business career in real estate and miscellaneous ventures {{Trump family}} about family members, relations and ancestry {{Trump media}} grouping Trump's media productions, media appearances and third-party works about Trump {{Trump presidency}} focusing on the election campaign, transition and presidency {{Trump executive actions}} lists the Trump administration's executive actions, including executive orders and presidential memoranda Duplication of contents across each of those should be avoided. There is also a navigation sidebar, {{Donald Trump series}}, which should only include a selection of the most relevant articles. Initial visibility: currently defaults to autocollapse To set this template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used: |state=collapsed: {{Donald Trump series|state=collapsed}} to show the template collapsed, i.e., hidden apart from its title bar |state=expanded: {{Donald Trump series|state=expanded}} to show the template expanded, i.e., fully visible |state=autocollapse: {{Donald Trump series|state=autocollapse}} shows the template collapsed to the title bar if there is a {{navbar}}, a {{sidebar}}, or some other table on the page with the collapsible attribute shows the template in its expanded state if there are no other collapsible items on the page If the |state= parameter in the template on this page is not set, the template's initial visibility is taken from the |default= parameter in the Collapsible option template. For the template on this page, that currently evaluates to autocollapse. For the navigation sidebar {{Donald Trump series}}, the |state= parameter has no effect; however, the |expanded= parameter can have the following values to expand their respective sections on specific pages: |expanded=Campaigns (for the Presidential campaigns section) |expanded=Russia controversies (for the Controversies involving Russia section) Use of the |expanded= parameter on this template causes the Business and personal section to collapse automatically. Any other value for the |expanded= parameter will cause all three sections to collapse. The above documentation is transcluded from Template:Donald Trump/doc.
