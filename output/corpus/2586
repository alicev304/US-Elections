The Federal government manages more than 350,000 buildings, 600,000 vehicles, and $500 billion annually in purchased goods and services and is the largest consumer of energy in the Nation. By increasing the efficiency of Federal operations, Federal agencies cut waste, save taxpayer dollars, reduce impacts on the environment, and promote clean air, land, and water. On May 17, 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order (EO) 13834, titled “Efficient Federal Operations,” which directs the heads of Federal agencies to manage their buildings, vehicles, and operations in a manner that increases efficiency, optimizes performance, eliminates unnecessary use of resources and protects the environment. EO 13834 sets forth goals for agencies to: (i) achieve and maintain annual reductions in building energy use; (ii) meet statutory requirements relating to the consumption of renewable energy and electricity; (iii) reduce potable and non-potable water consumption; (iv) utilize performance contracting to achieve energy, water, and building modernization, and infrastructure goals; (v) ensure new construction and major renovations conform to applicable building energy efficiency requirements and sustainable design principles, consider building efficiency when renewing or entering into leases, implement space utilization and optimization practices, and annually assess and report on building conformance to sustainability metrics; (vi) implement waste prevention and recycling measures; (vii) acquire, use and dispose of products and services, including electronics, in accordance with statutory mandates for purchasing preference; and (viii) track and report on energy management activities, performance improvements, cost reductions, greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water savings and other performance measures regarding sustainable management of Federal facilities, vehicle fleets, and operations. EO 13834, titled, “Efficient Federal Operations” Fact Sheet EO 13834 Implementing Instructions Resources for Implementing EO13834 As part of its responsibilities to implement the EO, CEQ oversees the Federal Interagency Sustainability Steering Committee, composed of Chief Sustainability Officers appointed by the head of each agency. Each agency reports annually to CEQ and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on implementation and progress toward EO goals in a Sustainability Report and Implementation Plan. Agency performance is evaluated by OMB in annual scorecards. Current progress demonstrated that the Federal government: Reduced energy intensity in Federal buildings by 25.5% since FY2003; Reduced potable water consumption by 27.2% since FY2007; In FY2018, leveraged over $1.1 billion in private sector investments (performance contracts) to drive energy and water savings in Federal facilities; In FY2018, used renewable energy to power 10.2% of its facility electricity needs; Increased renewable electricity produced on Federal land by 20% since FY 2017; Reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 27.6% since 2008 and in FY2018 reduced emissions by 2.6%; and Has 2,686 sustainable buildings in its portfolio.
