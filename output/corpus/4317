Appalachia region, including Coal Country, had clearly regressed since 2008; she had beaten Barack Obama 65-29 in Kentucky eight years earlier, and only beat rival Bernie Sanders 47-46 in 2016. She ran strongly in Louisville, where the African American population is highest, but lost many of the eastern counties in the state to Bernie Sanders, who had won a large victory in neighboring West Virginia the week prior.
