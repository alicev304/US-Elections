{{main|Electoral College (United States)}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral College map showing results of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in 30 states (red) and in [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] to capture 306 electoral votes. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]] won the popular vote in 20 states (blue) plus D.C. to capture 232 electoral votes. Of these, seven were cast by [[Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidential election|faithless electors]]—two pledged to Trump and five pledged to Clinton—for other persons.]]

Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] do not use this method, instead giving two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president. Although Electoral College members can vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 32 [[U.S. state|states]] plus the [[District of Columbia]] have laws against [[faithless elector]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> those electors who do not cast their electoral votes for the person for whom they have pledged to vote. Two [[Faithless_elector#U.S._Supreme_Court|cases]] questioning the constitutionality of these laws are currently pending before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting vice president, acting in his capacity as [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]], and read aloud to a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.

If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the Twelfth Amendment. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a [[contingent election]] in a ballot of the House of Representatives. For the purposes of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of the Senate is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote. The House has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice, in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]] and [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; the Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once, in [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]].

If the president is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect acts as president. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as president, pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment.

Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the "[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]]" (unless it is a sitting president who has won re-election).
