A dominant showing on Tuesday could give Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont a daunting advantage in the Democratic race.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times By Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns March 2, 2020 Late last year a group of first-term House Democrats, anxious over the party’s fractious presidential race, convened a series of discussions intended to spur unity. Led by Representatives Colin Allred of Texas and Haley Stevens of Michigan, they considered issuing a collective endorsement of one moderate candidate. The group held phone calls with Joseph R. Biden Jr., Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. But the lawmakers could not agree: Some were torn between the options, and others worried about alienating voters at home who backed other contenders, like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. A few issued solo endorsements of Mr. Biden, but the grander plan disintegrated. “There was not time to reach consensus over one candidate,” said Ms. Stevens, who eventually endorsed Michael R. Bloomberg, recalling the “fast-moving” blur of the lead-up to Iowa. That effort was just one in a series of abandoned or ineffective plans to rally the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, and the leaders and institutions of the political establishment, behind a single formidable contender who could stop the ascent of Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist promising a revolution in government. A gambit to have the powerful Democratic machine in Nevada back Mr. Biden, for instance, fizzled when the former vice president finished fifth in New Hampshire. Two outside spending groups formed to target Mr. Sanders were unable to inflict damage. Now, on the eve of Super Tuesday, when Democrats across 15 states and territories will hand out more than a third of the delegates required to claim the nomination, Mr. Sanders is within reach of a clear national lead and Mr. Biden is racing to catch up. In the last few days, moderate Democrats acting with a new sense of urgency have begun a large-scale effort to coalesce around Mr. Biden, with Mr. Buttigieg leaving the race on Sunday and Ms. Klobuchar abandoning her own campaign Monday. In a sign of the new, if frantic, spirit of unity, the two bitter foes both endorsed the former vice president at campaign events on Monday night in Dallas. But Mr. Sanders has become a formidable front-runner. The Vermont senator has put forth a sweeping set of policy prescriptions — far more ambitious than anything Mr. Biden and other moderates have proposed — to address defining concerns for many Democrats, like economic inequality and the soaring cost of health care and higher education. His agenda has galvanized liberal voters yearning for change. Mr. Sanders finished atop the first three voting states before trailing Mr. Biden in South Carolina, and polls show him ahead in the delegate-rich state of California on Tuesday. He holds significant financial and organizational advantages that he was able to accumulate over a long season of disarray among traditional Democrats. And he has begun to make an increasingly direct case to the rest of the party that his urgent message is the best match for a trying political moment, and that he is the candidate most prepared to do battle with President Trump. Interviews with more than 100 Democratic elected officials, campaign strategists, union leaders and donors revealed a party establishment that spent many months distressed about the implications of nominating Mr. Sanders but frozen in a state of anxiety over who would be the best alternative. Many of the most influential officials, organizations and donors in the party remain torn between their concern about Mr. Sanders’s chances in the general election, their fear of antagonizing his supporters, and their belated and often-rueful recognition that he has assembled a political movement with appeal well beyond the youthful, left-wing base he built in 2016. Top Democrats now believe that there are only two realistic paths forward in the presidential race: a dominant victory on Tuesday by Mr. Sanders that gives him a wide lead in the delegate count, or a battle for delegates over months of primary elections, that might allow Mr. Biden to pull ahead or force the nomination to be decided at the Milwaukee convention in July. Listen to ‘The Daily’: Inside the Mind of a Super Tuesday VoterOne suburban voter — who has a personal history with Joe Biden — asks himself which moderate candidate has the best chance of beating President Trump. transcript Back to The Daily bars 0:00/35:10 -35:10 transcript Listen to ‘The Daily’: Inside the Mind of a Super Tuesday Voter Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Jessica Cheung, Clare Toeniskoetter and Rachel Quester; with help from Robert Jimison; and edited by Lisa Tobin One suburban voter — who has a personal history with Joe Biden — asks himself which moderate candidate has the best chance of beating President Trump. michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: archived recording (crowd) Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie! michael barbaro In the first weeks of the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders was the only candidate to win big. And to win repeatedly. archived recording (bernie sanders) We won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus! [CHEERING] michael barbaro In Nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he’d built a coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and Hispanic voters. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he did it by narrowly beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with the leading moderate candidate, Joe Biden, losing support and stumbling badly. archived recording The only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these delegates, and Sanders now has 43 of them. That’s more than his closest rival Pete Buttigieg at 26. And now you can see Sanders also has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in this race. michael barbaro All of this left Sanders the front-runner — archived recording Down-ballot Democrats are very worried about Bernie ending up at the top of the ballot, but there’s speculation that the rest of the folks — the moderates and others — can’t get it together, and they can’t stop Bernie. michael barbaro — and the only one who could walk away from Super Tuesday, today, as the likely Democratic nominee. Then came South Carolina. archived recording (joe biden) Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the Democratic Party, we just won and we’ve won big because of you. michael barbaro And for the first time — archived recording (crowd) Let’s go Joe! Let’s go Joe! Let’s go Joe! michael barbaro — Joe Biden offered a vision of a different coalition, this one made up of black voters, older voters and suburbanites. archived recording Joe Biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every single county in the state, crushing Bernie Sanders by more than a 2-1 margin, with everyone else trailing badly. Biden’s big win helped him close the delegate gap considerably with Sanders. It’s very close. michael barbaro But South Carolina was just three days ago. archived recording Despite Biden’s big night, the confetti could stop for him on Super Tuesday, as Sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a potentially commanding delegate lead. michael barbaro And so the question now is, will Sanders sweep? Or, will the moderate wing of the party coalesce around Biden, and will the voters who had left him come back in time for Super Tuesday? It’s Tuesday, March 3. michael barbaro We are on a residential street in Arlington, Virginia. It’s a quite lovely neighborhood of colonial houses. I think it’s safe to say well-off. An affluent suburban community. clare toeniskoetter Can I do one of my favorite things? michael barbaro Which is what? clare toeniskoetter To look up how much these homes sell for? michael barbaro You would not be the first New Yorker to do that. clare toeniskoetter So this house right behind us — four beds, three baths, 2,600 square feet. Estimated price: $1.3 million. This house here, $1.3 million. No one’s ever going to invite me to their home after hearing this. [LAUGHS] They’ve still got a Christmas tree. knocking on door interposing voices Oh! Cute dog. Hi. michael barbaro You must be Brian. brian keane I’m Brian. michael barbaro I’m Michael. brian keane Hey, Michael. How are you? michael barbaro Jess, Clare. brian keane Jess, how are you? Nice to meet you. jessica cheung Hi! Nice to meet you. brian keane Clare, Brian KEANE. How are you? Nice to meet you. michael barbaro May we come in? brian keane Of course, of course. Nice to meet you. michael barbaro So on Sunday night I went with my colleagues Jessica Cheung and Clare Toeniskoetter to meet Brian Keane at his house in Arlington, a suburb about 15 minutes outside Washington, D.C. jessica cheung So cute in here. They’ve even got a fire going on. michael barbaro We get there — kate sawyer keane I’m Kate. Nice to meet you. michael barbaro — and he introduces us to his kids. brian keane So you met Tommy. And this is Julia, and this is Maddie, and this is Jack. jack keane Hello. brian keane And you met [INAUDIBLE] right? kate sawyer keane I just wanted to — michael barbaro There are so many of you! michael barbaro All five of them. And his dog, a yellow lab named Annie. And then we sit down in his living room. michael barbaro So, with your permission, we’ll start. brian keane Yes. michael barbaro Tell me who you are and what you do. brian keane So my name is Brian Keane, and I’m 52 years old. We’re here in Arlington, Virginia. michael barbaro So Brian, like a lot of people in Arlington, used to work on Capitol Hill. His wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many clients, the Democratic National Committee. He now runs a nonprofit organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable energy. michael barbaro So tell me about the politics of this community — Arlington, Virginia. brian keane Sure. It’s a wealthy community. And it’s a very well-read community, if you will. And the reason a lot of people kind of live here is because of the politics. And so they move to Washington — certainly that’s why I came here, because I love politics. michael barbaro What’s the kind of character of people’s political identification, if you could summarize it? brian keane It’s pretty easy to assume that they’re left of center. michael barbaro And you said left of center. My sense of this community is that that “center” word is important. That it’s left of center, but it’s not liberal “liberal.” I went back and looked at the 2016 primary for Arlington County and saw that Hillary Clinton won this county by a 2-to-1 ratio over Bernie Sanders. It wasn’t really even close. He got 32 percent. She got twice as much, 66 percent. brian keane We have a sense that if we’re going to be voting, we understand that you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don’t want to kind of just say like, oh, let’s just go crazy and vote for Mr. Potato Head because I think he’s great, and see what happens. michael barbaro But in the most recent polling, which was conducted before South Carolina, Sanders is actually leading the state of Virginia with 28 percent of the vote. Joe Biden has 19 percent, and Michael Bloomberg has 17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to Brian. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, look. Let’s be clear. The establishment is freaking out. The establishment is worried. Wall Street is worried. The drug companies are worried. Insurance companies are worried. michael barbaro When he and his friends hear Sanders going after the establishment — brian keane When you say Washington’s the problem, he’s probably talking about us, and that’s not really well received. michael barbaro — they hear that as him going after them. brian keane Yeah, like any industry town would be, right? So if you’re going to say, the car manufacturers stink, I think Detroit would take umbrage to that. He’s just a little mean. I don’t think I’d like him as my neighbor. michael barbaro What about as your Democratic nominee? I mean, what do you — brian keane I think it would be really, really bad for the party. michael barbaro Why? brian keane I don’t think, for every — and I really, really think Trump is bad for America — a socialist revolution is not what we’re asking we need. And if we have a nominee to stand up against Trump that says we need a socialist revolution, we’re going to lose. And we will lose our Senate. We’ll lose any strong candidates we have in the Senate, and we have a lot of strong candidates. michael barbaro You mean it will trickle down over the whole party. brian keane Oh yeah. Badly. Badly. michael barbaro This is how you hear a lot of establishment Democrats talking right now, that a Sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party. michael barbaro Given what you just laid out, who do most of your neighbors tend to support in this primary? brian keane So it’s, I’ve been all over the board, though. Like it just moves so fast. And my personal thing is so interesting, though, because I’ve always — my heart has always been like, I’m a Joe Biden guy at heart. michael barbaro What do you mean? brian keane I love the guy, but can you win? And then in that case, it’s like, so I need to go with a guy that’s a person who’s going to win. And so now I’m, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win, and I have to give up the guy I love, you know? michael barbaro You say “I’m a Joe guy” with so much conviction that I kind of want to go back to understand what you mean by that. brian keane Well, I came to Washington, D.C. to go to college here at American University. And this is a long story. Can I tell my long story? michael barbaro Please tell a long story. We didn’t come here for a short story. brian keane [LAUGHS] You asked for it. But at American University — michael barbaro But, to summarize: Brian went to college at American University, where he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to campus, and Joe Biden was one of them. This was in 1988, and Biden had just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught plagiarizing a speech. And then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely survived. brian keane And so the speech he gave for the Kennedy Political Union at A.U. was his first speech after having been driven out of the race and his aneurysm. So he shows up — michael barbaro You’re there, obviously. brian keane Yes, right. So I’m there. I’m just a senior in college, I’m a kid. And he shows up. He gets out of this car, and he’s like my best friend. He’s like, Brian, it’s so great to see you! You have no idea how glad I am to see you. And I’m like, Senator Biden, so nice to meet you. No, you have no idea how glad I am to meet you — uh, to see you. Not meet you. You know, he’s very good. It’s like, in case he has met me before, he’s like, so glad to see you! And it was like [GASPS], we’re best friends. This is amazing. archived recording (brian keane) [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to tonight’s program. My name is Brian F. KEANE, and I am the director of the Kennedy Political Union. brian keane Then we go to the lecture hall. archived recording (brian keane) Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. first entered public service in 1970 when he was elected to the Council of Newcastle County — excuse me — in New Jer— in Delaware. [LAUGHTER] Sorry. brian keane And — archived recording (brian keane) Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Joseph Biden. brian keane — he gives this unbelievable speech. archived recording (joe biden) Most of we public officials, when we’re about to speak somewhere, we start off and we say, I’m really happy to be here. Well folks, I’m happy to be here. I’m happy to be anywhere in light of [LAUGHS] the last 8 or 10 months. [APPLAUSE] brian keane And he kept going. archived recording (joe biden) I don’t see no leader right now of the Democratic Party who’s able to unite everyone. The Southern conservatives, the Northern liberals — brian keane He took every single question that was there. archived recording (joe biden) Well, the answer is yes. archived recording (crowd) [LAUGHTER] archived recording (joe biden) I’m serious. I’m serious. I’m serious. Don’t make me laugh. The answer is yes, I do see the possibility of uniting us so that we can win. brian keane They actually had to shut it down. They were like, we got to close the room. michael barbaro Senator, thank you very much — brian keane Exactly. Yeah, we’re done. archived recording (joe biden) [APPLAUSE] Thank you. brian keane And so, they shut the room down. So it’s, like, 11 o’clock at night now. And he says, hey, is there like a bar around here? And so I said, well, actually, there’s a tavern on campus. He’s like, oh, you got time? Let’s go get a beer. michael barbaro You’re having the proverbial beer with a politician in real life. brian keane And the guy was just great. Like it’s just me and Joe. And then he just says to the bartender, hey, how late are you guys open till? Last call, maybe 2 o’clock. Oh, great, great. Can I borrow your phone? Yeah. So he gives him his phone, and Joe dials and he goes, hey Beau, it’s Dad. I’m here at American University with Brian KEANE. Come on over. Get Hunter. Come on over, and let’s have a beer with Brian KEANE at American University. michael barbaro [LAUGHS] brian keane So the boys came over. And really, he was calling for a ride. [LAUGHS] And I was like, that was unbelievable. It was, like, the best night of my life. michael barbaro This is actually not the end of the story. brian keane To make this long story longer, that was 1989. So fast forward to 2007. There’s rumors that he’s going to run for president. So I’m taking the Amtrak, and I get to 30th Street Station and I go up the escalator. And I’m like, I think, just to myself, I’m like, I think that’s Joe Biden over there. And there’s a guy just holding the newspaper. He’s holding it up. And I said, excuse me, Mr. President. And he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. He looks me in the eye, and he goes, “American University.” michael barbaro Wow. brian keane And I go, oh my God! How do you remember that? That was 1989. He goes, that was a great night, wasn’t it? How are you man? How’s it going? How are you? And I said, well, are you running for president? And he’s like, well, why not? Like, why not? And so we got coffee, and then we waited in line for the Amtrak. And it was unbelievable. michael barbaro What impression did he leave you with? brian keane That he is the best politician. He loves people. And, actually, that is what the job is. And if you love people, you’re going to do well by people. michael barbaro So this time around, 2020, did you know right away? Did it feel like he was going to be your candidate? brian keane Well, I said to my wife, well, I got to go with Joe. We’re like best friends, you know? And she’s like, you don’t talk to the guy. laughter brian keane But I think it’s amazing that there’s a person that can make you feel like that. michael barbaro Right, in the race. brian keane Yes. So Joe enters 2020, and I said, well I got to be with Joe. michael barbaro Partly because of the relationship you had, partly because of his politics, all of it? brian keane Yeah, yeah. And that he is a Democrat’s Democrat to me. [music] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. michael barbaro Tell me about what’s happened since then. brian keane So I love Joe. Joe’s my guy. But he has not been a strong candidate. I think he doesn’t look good. I think he’s not sounding good. And Joe Biden, who is a great guy, is playing by a rulebook that was written in 1980 maybe, 1972. And that’s really concerning to me because Donald Trump’s going to fillet him very quickly. I mean, we’re seeing these debates. Joe Biden’s version of kind of hand-to-hand combat is to just say it louder, is to yell. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anchor) Mayor, mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree. Let me she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so lets get those things straight too. brian keane I kind of feel like I’m walking through a nursing home and seeing an old friend, and he’s just yelling at me. And it’s like, you’re an old friend, why are you yelling? He just says it louder, you know, and it’s like, stop yelling. archived recording (bernie sanders) — separate health care plan. archived recording Senator Klobuchar, I’m going to come to you. archived recording (joe biden) My name was mentioned. archived recording I’m going to come to you for 45 seconds. 45 seconds for Vice President Biden. archived recording (joe biden) I’m the only guy who’s not interrupted here, all right? And I’m going to interrupt now. It costs $30 trillion. Let’s get that straight. brian keane It’s like he doesn’t know how to take on his opponents without just yelling it. And he was stumbling on these words. archived recording (joe biden) I agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. I’m sorry. archived recording Thank you, Vice President. michael barbaro You just felt he was faltering. brian keane Yeah. michael barbaro So as you’re confronting what you see as his weaknesses, you’re watching these debate performances, it sounds like you’re starting to flirt with other candidates around this time. And where is your eye starting to drift? brian keane To everybody, actually. And then along comes Bloomberg. And there’s a guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to understand social media. And that’s really kind of cool. And on an electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with Trump on that and put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing. michael barbaro So when it comes to Bloomberg, for you he has this combination of values and resources. That’s the appeal. brian keane Yeah. And as such, he could win. michael barbaro And what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any reservations, given you pause? brian keane That he so quickly got off message and kind of got sidetracked. michael barbaro In the debates. brian keane Yeah, in the debates. And to me, the problem there is, oh, so now you’re going to go one-on-one with Trump? Maybe you’re not the guy. This is a problem. This all a game-day decision for me, right? So it’s — election’s Tuesday. So, you know, can Trump destroy Bloomberg? Can he destroy Biden? Yes and yes, perhaps. Who has kind of the better heart, and I think I have that answer, because Joe is the guy. I love Joe. Who has the money to be able to do this? Bloomberg does. But Biden’s victory in South Carolina, game changer for me. michael barbaro Really? brian keane Yeah. michael barbaro Why? brian keane I didn’t believe he was going to be able to do that. I didn’t believe him when he said, it’s a firewall. And the numbers are unbelievable. It’s like, wow. Joe did it. So then you come back to Bloomberg, and it’s like, well, I don’t know. michael barbaro Sounds like the thing that matters most you was just victory. Is seeing Joe Biden, this person who was faltering onstage, you didn’t like the way he was presenting, suddenly seeming electable because he had won an election? brian keane No. michael barbaro No? brian keane The winning was really important, but that speech — archived recording (joe biden) Thank you, thank you, thank you, South Carolina! brian keane — really grabbed me. archived recording (joe biden) Let me talk directly to Democrats across America, especially those who will be voting on Super Tuesday. brian keane And it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda. archived recording (joe biden) If Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the N.R.A. and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. And if the Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat [CHEERING], a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us. brian keane And so now, he’s back. archived recording (joe biden) So here’s the deal. Let’s get back up. We’re decent. We’re brave. We’re resilient people. We can believe again. We’re better than this moment. We’re better than this president. So get up, take back our country. This the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. michael barbaro So at the moment — this is Sunday night, almost 9 o’clock — you are leaning toward Joe Biden. OK. What are the odds that you change your mind between now and Super Tuesday? brian keane It’s really amazing because I’m just so back and forth and back and forth every day. And every hour of every day. michael barbaro I want to talk about what I’m hearing you say, because I think this is a larger question happening in Virginia on Super Tuesday and part of the reason why we’re here, which is that it seems like aside from defeating Trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for you is not having Bernie Sanders be the nominee. Is that fair to say? brian keane A equals B, and B equals C. Because if my number one issue is to beat Trump, then we need the candidate who can do that. So that’s really the calculus that’s happening here. michael barbaro But I’m hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, Biden and Bloomberg. And the latest polling has Sanders with close to what he had in 2016 in Arlington. Biden and Bloomberg are around 20 percent too, because they’re sharing a lot of voters. So if on Super Tuesday, Sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like Virginia, it will likely have been because Biden and Bloomberg split the vote. And I wonder if you’re thinking about that at all. brian keane I am thinking about that. I think every other election has been like, oh, I don’t watch the polls. I just vote. I vote my heart. I vote the issues, you know? But now we’re all watching the polls. We’re all kind of — michael barbaro Gaming. brian keane It’s unbelievable, right? We all think we’re on CNN and it’s like, this is crazy. But we feel like we have to because the end game is which of these candidates can beat Trump? And that’s why I’m going to be looking at the polls. And I may actually delay my actual vote on Tuesday, unlike like — Usually, I vote before I go to work. But I may vote after work, depending on afternoon polling. Because if I want to vote for the candidate — if it looks like Virginia can — let’s see if I can say this right. If it looks like Bloomberg and Biden, if one of them is going to knock off Sanders in Virginia, I will vote for who can do that. michael barbaro So to be clear, Brian is saying that on election day, he is going to watch the early results come in before he goes to place his own vote. And his logic is that he’s going to try to limit the chance that a moderate split would lead to a Sanders win in Virginia. brian keane I think I’m being part of the solution, because I’m putting so much frigging effort into this thing. [LAUGHS] It’s unbelievable, you know? And it is. It’s amazing. And I think, actually, so many people are in my neighborhood and my friends, it’s really amazing. And people are saying, so what should I do? They’re really thinking this through. michael barbaro As Brian is talking, what he’s describing about the efforts that he and his friends and his neighbors are making is reminding me of what happened to the Republicans back in 2016. During the same time that year, the establishment was paralyzed by Donald Trump’s success with voters in the primaries. They were terrified of it, but they didn’t really know what to do about it and kind of did nothing, really. And then Trump basically ran away with Super Tuesday, and after that, by the time party leaders got organized and tried to stop him, it was too late. And people like Brian are a bit like the Democratic version of the Never Trump movement. They see Sanders as the Trump of the left, and they’re trying to do everything within their power to avoid that from happening on their side. michael barbaro I keep thinking about the way you’ve talked about Sanders and the risk he poses to the Democratic Party. If Sanders becomes the nominee, if it came down to it in a general election, Sanders versus Trump, what would you do? brian keane So for me, that’s really going to depend on his number two. michael barbaro There’s not an automatic “I’m going to be voting for the Democrat” coming out of your mouth right now. brian keane Correct. I might take some solace in a youthful vice president. Elizabeth Warren could get me for sure, for sure. michael barbaro Did you ever think you’d be in the position of imagining the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary being a person that you can’t instantly say, I’d vote for? brian keane I could never imagine that the Democrats would nominate someone who’s not a Democrat. So that’s really the answer. And I don’t think we’ll nominate someone who is not a Democrat. archived recording (joe biden) Do you think that it’s inevitably hard for someone who lives in a community of expensive houses in suburban Virginia to ever really understand why people might want to break the system? brian keane No. I totally understand why people would want to break the system, and I really know the system doesn’t work for so many people. Millions and millions of people. It’s not a perfect union. I mean, really isn’t. But we are trying to create a perfect union. That’s kind of the beauty of the country. To use the language of revolution, it’s not responsible, it’s not helpful. It’s not really what we should be doing, especially against Trump. michael barbaro Well, thank you very much for your time. brian keane Thank you. michael barbaro I really appreciate it. brian keane Thank you so much. [music] archived recording (amy klobuchar) Today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president. archived recording (pete buttigieg) I am delighted to endorse and support Joe Biden for president. archived recording (beto o'rourke) Tomorrow, March 3, 2020, I will be casting my ballot for Joe Biden. michael barbaro On Monday night, three former Democratic candidates for president endorsed Joe Biden simultaneously in a show of force by the party’s moderate wing, as they seek to block Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee. archived recording (amy klobuchar) I believe, and it’s the reason I’m up here, that we are never going to out-divide the divider-in-chief because if we spend the next four months dividing our party and going at each other, we will spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear apart this country. michael barbaro At a rally in Texas, one of the 14 states to hold its primary today, Amy Klobuchar, who had dropped out of the race hours before, was joined by Pete Buttigieg, who dropped out a day earlier, and Beto O’Rourke, who left the race in November. archived recording (beto o'rourke) We need somebody who can beat Donald Trump, and in Joe Biden, we have that man. We have someone — michael barbaro Sanders, appearing on CNN, dismissed the endorsements and suggested that they would have little impact. archived recording (bernie sanders) From day one, we have been taking on the establishment. And let me be very clear, it is no surprise they do not want me to become president.

You can no longer change the shape of the epidemic, and you’re purely moving in that sense to save as many lives as you can.

In South Korea, infections have doubled since Friday to more than 4,300. And in the U.S., as of Monday night, authorities had reported 100 cases and, in Washington State, six deaths from the virus. [music] That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. The mood of emergency among party leaders has been simmering for months but it only translated into a surge of support for Mr. Biden at the very last minute. “If we go through March 3 and don’t show that we have a nominee who can appeal to a broad swath of our party, we’re going to be in serious trouble,” said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and Democratic National Committee chairman, who endorsed Mr. Biden over the weekend. Even now, authority figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former President Barack Obama have stayed on the sidelines, convinced their intervention would only fuel Mr. Sanders’s claims of an insider plot against him. Influential labor groups and advocacy organizations have either stayed quiet or supported multiple candidates. The candidates themselves have made fitful or flawed efforts to garner mainstream Democratic support: A number of lawmakers open to endorsing Mr. Biden said he did little to reach out to them for most of the campaign, letting weeks or months go by without any contact from him or his aides. A flashy late entrant, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, initially impressed elected officials with an energetic charm offensive and a war-machine campaign operation. But many Democrats developed serious reservations about him after a damaging debate-stage clash with Ms. Warren last month. Underdog moderates persisted in pleading with party leaders for help, promising to continue their campaigns even at the risk of playing a spoiler’s role for Mr. Biden or Mr. Bloomberg. Last week, only three days before he dropped out of the race, Mr. Buttigieg visited the Capitol to seek endorsements and vowed in a private meeting with centrist Democrats that he would not withdraw. It was only after South Carolina, when internal campaign projections were clear that they faced a rout on Super Tuesday, that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar dropped out. And while Mr. Sanders has made private overtures toward centrists, his harpoons toward “corporate Democrats” and the scorched-earth tactics of his supporters have continued to unnerve Democratic leaders. Christine Pelosi, one of the speaker’s daughters, last month contacted Mr. Sanders’s advisers to convey her unhappiness that the actress Susan Sarandon, who is backing the Vermont senator, had called for Speaker Pelosi’s ouster, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations. (Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, indicated in a message to the younger Ms. Pelosi that Ms. Sarandon wasn’t speaking for the Sanders campaign, according to a Democratic official familiar with their exchange). Last Wednesday, the speaker herself seemed to have Mr. Sanders on her mind. That day, she declared in a news conference that Democrats would “wholeheartedly support” whomever their voters nominated. But in a closed-door session in the Capitol with her leadership team, Ms. Pelosi’s irritation was unmistakable, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the conversation. With Mr. Sanders largely ignoring the roster of bills her majority has passed and boasting that only a true progressive can defeat Mr. Trump, the speaker said House Democrats proved in 2018 how to win elections; she cited their legislative accomplishments and dismissed the “geniuses” on television who claim the party is shifting sharply to the left. Ms. Pelosi also invoked her own liberal credentials: In her basement, she noted, she still had old campaign signs supporting progressive causes. Tug of war within the establishment It was not only the national Democratic establishment that declined to unite around Mr. Biden or anyone else. Efforts in the states crumbled or proved ineffective: After the muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden’s campaign hoped to make a strong stand in Nevada, the first diverse state to weigh in on the nomination. Mr. Biden’s advisers privately projected optimism that they could win endorsements from the most important forces in Nevada politics: Gov. Steve Sisolak, a popular moderate; the casino workers union; and Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader in the Senate. But spooked by Mr. Biden’s debilitating loss in New Hampshire, none of them backed him before the caucuses. Mr. Sanders won the state by an overwhelming margin. As in other states, Democratic leaders said there had been limited outreach by Mr. Biden. In an interview before the caucuses, Mr. Reid said he had not heard from him or his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, in “several weeks.” Another candidate was more proactive, pursuing Mr. Reid and many other Democratic leaders with solicitousness: Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg visited Capitol Hill and dispatched aides around the country to seek endorsements and outline his plans for the campaign against Mr. Trump. His advisers have paraded Democrats through their Times Square headquarters. And even though he was not competing in Nevada, Mr. Bloomberg visited Mr. Reid and his wife, Landra, at their home outside Las Vegas. By early February, Mr. Bloomberg had effectively frozen the support of other moderates, overwhelming voters with advertising and tantalizing Democratic power brokers with his vision for the general election. In an illustration of Mr. Bloomberg’s allure even to maverick Democrats, his advisers reached out to Andrew Yang after he withdrew from the presidential race to offer counsel about a possible campaign for mayor of New York City next year. Yet Mr. Bloomberg has not always lived up to the image of a can-do executive he presents in his $500 million advertising campaign. At a private meeting with Democratic governors in Washington, right after the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Bloomberg delivered a casual performance that alternately charmed and puzzled several attendees. He spoke vaguely about how he would unite the party and win over progressives, suggesting he could heal wounds by being kind to his critics in public and sending flowers to their wives, according to multiple people present. In an awkward exchange, Mr. Bloomberg said he was uncertain why Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, was faring poorly in the race; when Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon suggested gender could be a factor, Mr. Bloomberg said he disagreed. He emerged with no new supporters. Mr. Bloomberg still secured a stream of endorsements from prominent Democrats. But his campaign lost a number of defectors because of his disastrous first debate, which dented his polling numbers and emboldened his critics. “You can’t sell Bloomberg to the country,” said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden co-chair. “How’s he going to build a base with the stuff he’s said?” Even as the race moved on from their early-state successes, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg clung to hope in confounding ways. Mr. Buttigieg insisted to donors that if he raised enough money, he could pull off an upset at the convention. Ms. Klobuchar was seen as a potential contender after her third-place finish in New Hampshire but, always attuned to her press coverage, she spent time in recent days sending personal messages to media figures complaining about their reporting and boasting of her energetic campaign schedule. Despite their wariness of Mr. Sanders, party leaders have hesitated to mount an all-out effort against him. A pair of outside-spending efforts targeting him have struggled to get off the ground: Ad campaigns in Iowa and Nevada by a pro-Israel group failed to halt Mr. Sanders’s advance, and a second group, known as the Big Tent Project, has managed to cobble together only a few million dollars. At a February luncheon for vulnerable lawmakers, Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pressed Democrats not to rule out candidates whom they could feel pressure to support later. Her entreaty came after one vulnerable Democrat, Representative Anthony Brindisi of New York, told his hometown paper he would not support Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren. But Ms. Bustos is said to be worried about Mr. Sanders, and her committee plans to conduct polling in swing districts to see how nominating him might affect House races. At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg has continued stoking that mood of alarm as he bids for, if not the heart, then at least the more calculating head of the Democratic establishment. In a private briefing in Charleston, S.C., last week, one of Mr. Bloomberg’s senior advisers, Dan Kanninen, made an extensive presentation detailing the risks of nominating Mr. Sanders. “Florida is off the map,” he said, citing Mr. Sanders’s past praise of some of Fidel Castro’s programs, according to one person who shared a detailed account of the meeting. In the same session, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., warned that Mr. Sanders had a “cultlike following,” and claimed Mr. Biden was no longer a viable option: “This is a choice between Bernie, Mike and Trump,” she said. Days later, Mr. Biden won South Carolina by nearly 30 points. Sanders’s race to lose On the eve of Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders still appears to hold an upper hand, with a lead in national polls backed by his muscular fund-raising machine and grass-roots following. On Sunday, he announced that he had raised $46.5 million in February alone. Given Mr. Sanders’s history of acrimony with the Democratic establishment, some in the party are skeptical that he can be induced to work cooperatively with party leadership. Some of his advisers are eager to signal that he can, though they calculated they would have a better chance after what they are hoping will be a breakthrough on Super Tuesday. Mr. Sanders has made efforts toward comity in the past: He met several times last year with more moderate Democrats in Washington, pitching himself as a nominee they could at least tolerate. Meeting with the New Democrat Coalition last year, Mr. Sanders conceded that he had no hope of being their first choice, but said that he hoped they could accept him eventually, according to a lawmaker who heard his pitch. Last summer, Mr. Sanders dined with another group of House members to make the case that his economic message and outsider’s approach would have wide traction in the general election. “Bernie’s argument is, ‘Don’t pigeonhole me as just a progressive candidate,’” said Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, who attended the dinner. But Mr. Sanders has done little over the last month to reassure skeptics within his party, striking a posture of defiance that may have helped accelerate the late movement toward Mr. Biden. Most senior Democrats are hoping that Mr. Sanders’s forward march can be slowed, and some have urged Mr. Obama to intervene. Mr. Obama has shown no inclination to do so, reasoning that he must hang back to preserve his ability to help unify the party at the end of a messy nominating process. Mr. Biden’s aides see that argument as so much malarkey, and they have conveyed as much to Mr. Obama’s inner circle, arguing that the former president’s leverage would evaporate once Mr. Sanders accrued millions of votes. They have pleaded with Mr. Obama’s camp to distance him from Mr. Bloomberg, who has run saturation-level advertising showing images of himself with the former president. When a poll came out last week showing that many Democratic voters believe Mr. Obama is supporting Mr. Bloomberg, the Biden campaign shared it with Mr. Obama’s aides. Party leaders are already preparing for the possibility of a contested convention, and many superdelegates have indicated they are open to selecting a nominee besides Mr. Sanders if he collects the most delegates but falls short of a majority. Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, has been clear in conversations with allies that he will abide by the current rules and would not resist an effort by superdelegates to determine the nomination on a second ballot. Referring to the number of delegates needed for a majority, Mr. Perez told one Democrat, “1991 delegates are required,” and noted that Mr. Sanders is familiar with the guidelines. With the identity of the Democratic standard-bearer unknown, Mr. Schumer has begun to ponder ways of uniting the party behind whoever that person might be: The Senate leader is particularly focused on the idea of nominating an African-American woman for vice president, mulling names like Senator Kamala Harris of California, Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Val Demings of Florida, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer. As long as a contested convention remains possible, that could make it even harder for any single candidate to put together a decisive primary coalition. Mr. Reid of Nevada said he was hopeful the race would not last until Milwaukee. But if no candidate achieved a delegate majority by the end of primary voting in June, Mr. Reid said last month that he was prepared to step in to arrange a deal before the convention in mid-July. In the run-up to his own state’s caucuses, Mr. Reid reached for a conciliatory role and cautioned Democrats not to put pressure on Mr. Sanders “to tone down anything.” Mr. Trump, he said then, could be defeated by any of the top Democrats. But nine days after Nevada Democrats voted, and weeks after his intervention could have resurrected Mr. Biden and slowed Mr. Sanders in the state, Mr. Reid had evidently reconsidered: On Monday, he issued a belated endorsement of Mr. Biden, calling him the best candidate “to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump’s presidency.” Our 2020 Election Guide Updated April 28, 2020 The Latest Hillary Clinton, during a virtual town hall-style event about the impact of the coronavirus on women, announced her support for Joseph R.
