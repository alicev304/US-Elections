Non-voting members for the District of Columbia and Territories of the United States were also elected. These elections coincided with the election of President Donald Trump, although his party lost seats in both chambers of Congress. The winners of this election served in the 115th Congress, with seats apportioned among the states based on the 2010 United States Census. In October 2015, the House elected a new Speaker, Republican Paul Ryan, who was re-elected in the new term. Democrat Nancy Pelosi continued to lead her party as Minority Leader. Elections were also held on the same day for the U.S. Senate, many governors, and other state and local elections.

Incumbents not running for re-election have parentheses around their names, while incumbents with a caret (^) sought re-election, but were defeated in the primary election. Note that safeness of a district is not necessarily a prediction as to outcome. District CPVI Incumbent First elected 2014 result Cook Nov 7, 2016[46] DKE Nov 7, 2016[47] Roth. Nov 3, 2016[48] Sab.

Gaskins (Democratic) 27.8% Primary dates[edit] This table shows the primary dates for regularly-scheduled elections. It also shows the type of primary. In an "open" primary, any registered voter can vote in any party's primary. In a "closed" primary, only voters registered with a specific party can vote in that party's primary. In a "top-two" primary, all candidates run against each other regardless of party affiliation, and the top two candidates advance to the second round of voting (in Louisiana, a candidate can win the election by winning a majority of the vote in the first round). All of the various other primary types are classified as "hybrid." Alaska in 2008 provides one example of a hybrid primary: the Democratic Party allowed unaffiliated voters to vote in its primary, while the Republican Party only allowed party members to vote in its primary.[58] State Date[59] Type[58] Alabama March 1R Open Arkansas March 1R Open Texas March 1R Open Mississippi March 8 Hybrid Illinois March 15 Hybrid North Carolina March 15 Hybrid Ohio March 15 Hybrid Maryland April 26 Hybrid Pennsylvania April 26 Hybrid Indiana May 3 Hybrid Nebraska May 10 Hybrid West Virginia May 10 Hybrid Idaho May 17 Hybrid Kentucky May 17 Closed Oregon May 17 Hybrid Georgia May 24R Open California June 7 Top-two Iowa June 7 Hybrid Montana June 7 Open New Jersey June 7 Closed New Mexico June 7 Closed North Carolina June 7 Hybrid South Dakota June 7R Hybrid Nevada June 14 Closed North Dakota June 14 Open South Carolina June 14R Hybrid Virginia June 14 Hybrid Colorado June 28 Hybrid New York June 28 Closed Oklahoma June 28R Hybrid Utah June 28 Hybrid Kansas Aug 2 Closed Michigan Aug 2 Open Missouri Aug 2 Open Washington Aug 2 Top-two Tennessee Aug 4 Hybrid Connecticut Aug 9 Hybrid Minnesota Aug 9 Open Vermont Aug 9 Open Wisconsin Aug 9 Open Hawaii Aug 13 Open Alaska Aug 16 Hybrid Wyoming Aug 16 Closed Arizona Aug 30 Hybrid Florida Aug 30 Closed Massachusetts Sep 8 Hybrid Delaware Sep 13 Closed New Hampshire Sep 13 Hybrid Rhode Island Sep 13 Hybrid Louisiana Nov 8 Top-two RIndicates a state that requires primary run-off elections under certain conditions.
