It was proposed by Congress on March 23, 1971, and ratified on July 1, 1971, the quickest ratification of an amendment in history. This amendment was important to the Student Movement because they declared that if they were old enough to be drafted into a war they were against, then they should be old enough to vote against and have a voice in their government.[1] Various public officials had supported lowering the voting age during the mid-20th century, but were unable to gain the legislative momentum necessary for passing a constitutional amendment. The drive to lower the voting age from 21 to 18 grew across the country during the 1960s, driven in large part by the military draft held during the Vietnam War, as well as the student activism movement. The draft conscripted young men between the ages of 18 and 21 into the armed forces, primarily the U.S. Army, to serve in or support military combat operations in Vietnam.[2] A common slogan of proponents of lowering the voting age was "old enough to fight, old enough to vote."[3] Congress lowered the national voting age to 18 in a 1970 bill that extended the Voting Rights Act, but the Supreme Court subsequently held in the case of Oregon v. Mitchell that Congress could not lower the voting age for state and local elections. Shortly after that ruling, Congress proposed and the states ratified the Twenty-sixth Amendment, which constitutionally protects voting rights for individuals between 18 and 21 years old.

The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of age. Section 2. The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.[4] Background[edit] Prior legislation[edit] Senator Harley Kilgore began advocating for a lowered voting age in 1941 in the 77th Congress.[5] Despite the support of fellow senators, representatives, and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Congress failed to pass any national change. However, public interest in lowering the vote became a topic of interest at the local level. In 1943 and 1955 respectively, the Georgia and Kentucky legislatures passed measures to lower the voting age to 18.[6] President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his 1954 State of the Union address, became the first president to publicly support prohibiting age-based denials of suffrage for those 18 and older.[7] During the 1960s, both Congress and the state legislatures came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the Vietnam War, in which many young men who were ineligible to vote were conscripted to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. "Old enough to fight, old enough to vote" was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to World War II, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt lowered the military draft age to eighteen. In 1963, the President's Commission on Registration and Voting Participation, in its report to President Johnson, further encouraged considering lowering the voting age. Historian Thomas H. Neale argues that the move to lower the voting age followed a historical pattern similar to other extensions of the franchise; with the escalation of the war in Vietnam, constituents were mobilized and eventually a constitutional amendment passed.[8] In 1970, Senator Ted Kennedy proposed amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to lower the voting age nationally.[9] On June 22, 1970, President Richard Nixon signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections.[10] In his statement on signing the extension, Nixon said: Despite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one provision, I have signed the bill. I have directed the Attorney General to cooperate fully in expediting a swift court test of the constitutionality of the 18-year-old provision.[11] Subsequently, Oregon and Texas challenged the law in court, and the case came before the Supreme Court in 1970 as Oregon v. Mitchell.[12] By this time, four states had a minimum voting age below 21: Georgia, Kentucky, Alaska and Hawaii.[13][14] Oregon v. Mitchell[edit] During debate of the 1970 extension of the Voting Rights Act, Senator Ted Kennedy argued that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to pass national legislation lowering the voting age.[15] In the 1966 decision of Katzenbach v. Morgan, the Supreme Court had ruled that "if Congress acts to enforce the 14th Amendment by passing a law declaring that a type of state law discriminates against a certain class of persons, the Supreme Court will let the law stand if the justices can 'perceive a basis' for Congress's actions".[16] President Nixon disagreed with Kennedy. In a letter to the Speaker of the House and the House minority and majority leaders, he asserted that the issue is not whether the voting age should be lowered, but how; in his own interpretation of the Katzenbach case, Nixon argued that to include age as something discriminatory would be too big a stretch and voiced concerns that the damage of a Supreme Court decision to overturn the Voting Rights Act could be disastrous.[17] In Oregon v. Mitchell (1970), the Supreme Court considered whether the voting-age provisions Congress added to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 were constitutional. The Court struck down the provisions that established 18 as the voting age in state and local elections. However, the Court upheld the provision establishing the voting age as 18 in federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.[18][19] The decision resulted in states being able to maintain 21 as the voting age in state and local elections, but being required to establish separate voter rolls so that voters between 18 and 20 years old could vote in federal elections.[20] Opposition[edit] Although the Twenty-sixth Amendment passed faster than any other constitutional amendment, about 17 states refused to pass measures to lower their minimum voting ages after Nixon signed the 1970 extension to the Voting Rights Act.[5] Opponents to extending the vote to youths questioned the maturity and responsibility of people at the age of 18. Professor William G. Carleton wondered why the vote was proposed for youth at a time when the period of adolescence had grown so substantially rather than in the past when people had more responsibilities at earlier ages.[21] Carleton further criticized the move to lower the vote citing American preoccupations with youth in general, exaggerated reliance on higher education, and equating technological savvy with responsibility and intelligence.[22] He denounced the military service argument as well, calling it a "cliche".[23] Considering the ages of soldiers in the Civil War, he asserted that literacy and education were not the grounds for limiting voting; rather, common sense and the capacity to understand the political system grounded voting age restrictions.[24] James J. Kilpatrick, a political columnist, asserted that the states were "extorted into ratifying the Twenty-sixth Amendment".[25] In his article, he claims that by passing the 1970 extension to the Voting Rights Act, Congress effectively forced the States to ratify the amendment lest they be forced to financially and bureaucratically cope with maintaining two voting registers. George Gallup also mentions the cost of registration in his article showing percentages favoring or opposing the amendment, and he draws particular attention to the lower rates of support among adults aged 30–49 and over 50 (57% and 52% respectively) as opposed to those aged 18–20 and 21–29 (84% and 73% respectively).[26] Proposal and ratification[edit] The Twenty-sixth Amendment in the National Archives Passage by Congress[edit] See also: Presidency of Richard Nixon § Constitutional amendments On March 10, 1971, the Senate voted 94–0 in favor of proposing a Constitutional amendment to guarantee that the minimum voting age could not be higher than 18.[27] On March 23, 1971, the House of Representatives voted 401–19 in favor of the proposed amendment.[28] 1971 U.S. House Twenty-sixth Amendment vote:[29] Party Total votes Democratic Republican Yes 236 165 401 (92.6%) No 7 12 19 (4.4%) Not Voting 10 3 13 (3%) Vacant 0 0 2 Result: Confirmed Vote By Members Roll call votes on the 26th Amendment Representative Seat Vote Nick Begich AK at-large Yes Jack Edwards AL 1st Yes William Louis Dickinson AL 2nd Yes George W.

Ratification was completed on July 1, 1971, after the amendment had been ratified by the following thirty-eight states:[30] Connecticut: March 23, 1971 Delaware: March 23, 1971 Minnesota: March 23, 1971 Tennessee: March 23, 1971 Washington: March 23, 1971 Hawaii: March 24, 1971 Massachusetts: March 24, 1971 Montana: March 29, 1971 Arkansas: March 30, 1971 Idaho: March 30, 1971 Iowa: March 30, 1971 Nebraska: April 2, 1971 New Jersey: April 3, 1971 Kansas: April 7, 1971 Michigan: April 7, 1971 Alaska: April 8, 1971 Maryland: April 8, 1971 Indiana: April 8, 1971 Maine: April 9, 1971 Vermont: April 16, 1971 Louisiana: April 17, 1971 California: April 19, 1971 Colorado: April 27, 1971 Pennsylvania: April 27, 1971 Texas: April 27, 1971 South Carolina: April 28, 1971 West Virginia: April 28, 1971 New Hampshire: May 13, 1971 Arizona: May 14, 1971 Rhode Island: May 27, 1971 New York: June 2, 1971 Oregon: June 4, 1971 Missouri: June 14, 1971 Wisconsin: June 22, 1971 Illinois: June 29, 1971 Alabama: June 30, 1971 Ohio: June 30, 1971 North Carolina: July 1, 1971 Having been ratified by three-fourths of the States (38), the Twenty-sixth Amendment became part of the Constitution. On July 5, 1971, the Administrator of General Services, Robert Kunzig, certified its adoption. President Nixon and Julianne Jones, Joseph W. Loyd Jr., and Paul S. Larimer of the "Young Americans in Concert" also signed the certificate as witnesses. During the signing ceremony, held in the East Room of the White House, Nixon talked about his confidence in the youth of America. As I meet with this group today, I sense that we can have confidence that America's new voters, America's young generation, will provide what America needs as we approach our 200th birthday, not just strength and not just wealth but the 'Spirit of '76' a spirit of moral courage, a spirit of high idealism in which we believe in the American dream, but in which we realize that the American dream can never be fulfilled until every American has an equal chance to fulfill it in their own life.[31] The amendment was subsequently ratified by the following states, bringing the total number of ratifying states to forty-three:[30] 39. Oklahoma: July 1, 1971 40. Virginia: July 8, 1971 41. Wyoming: July 8, 1971 42. Georgia: October 4, 1971 43. South Dakota: March 4, 2014[32] No action has been taken on the amendment by the states of Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, or Utah.
