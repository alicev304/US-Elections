The population was 7,603 at the 2010 census.[6] St. Johnsbury is located approximately 10 miles (16 km) northwest of the Connecticut River and 48 miles (77 km) south of the Canada-U.S. border. St. Johnsbury is the largest town by population in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont and has long served as a commercial center for the region. In 2006, the town was named "Best Small Town" in National Geographic Adventure's "Where to live and play" feature.[7] The more densely settled southern half of the town is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as a census-designated place, where over 81% of the population resides.

It was regranted by Vermont in 1786 as Dunmore, and settled the same year. An early settler was Jonathan Arnold, a member of the Continental Congress and author of Rhode Island's act of secession from the United Kingdom in May 1776. Arnold left Rhode Island in 1787 and, with six other families, built homes at what is now the town center.[8] This monument, located in Courthouse Park, honors those volunteers who died in the Civil War. By 1790, the village had grown to 143 inhabitants, and the first town meeting took place in Arnold's home that year, where the name St. Johnsbury was adopted. According to local lore, Vermont founder Ethan Allen himself proposed naming the town St. John in honor of his friend Jean de Crèvecœur, a French-born author and agriculturist and a friend of Benjamin Franklin. (He was known in the United States as J. Hector St. John.) According to this account, de Crèvecœur suggested instead the unusual St. Johnsbury to differentiate it from Saint John, New Brunswick.[9] In 1916, F.B. Sanborn of Concord, Massachusetts gave a talk to the Old Planters Society of Salem in Boston titled "Hector St. John, An Old Evasive Planter." This talk was published in The Massachusetts Magazine (20th century publication).[10] In his talk, Sanborn provided details about the life of the friend of Ethan Allen, namely J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur. In the mid-19th century, St. Johnsbury became a minor manufacturing center, with the main products being scales — the platform scale was invented there by Thaddeus Fairbanks in 1830 — and maple syrup and related products. With the arrival of the railroad line from Boston to Montreal in the 1850s, St. Johnsbury grew quickly and was named the shire town (county seat) in 1856, replacing Danville. The oldest occupied residence in St. Johnsbury was built in 1798 and located on the corner of Summer and Central streets, attached to the J. J. Palmer house. The former St. Johnsbury Fairground was located where Interstates 91 and 93 converge, south of the town. The Third Vermont Regiment drilled there prior to joining the Union Army during the Civil War.[11] The first air flight in Vermont occurred at the fair on April 19, 1910.[12] In the 1940s the town contained three major industries, each then the largest in the world. One was Fairbanks Scales, another was a maple sugar candy company, while a third made candlepins for bowling. The rest of the economy was mostly rural.[13] Geography[edit] St. Johnsbury is located at 44°25′N 72°01′W﻿ / ﻿44.417°N 72.017°W﻿ / 44.417; -72.017, elevation 212.4 m (697 ft).[14] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.8 square miles (95.2 km2), of which 36.4 square miles (94.3 km2) is land and 0.35 square miles (0.9 km2), or 0.96%, is water.[6] Situated at the confluence of the Passumpsic, Moose and Sleepers rivers, the town lies at the heart of the Passumpsic River basin, one of the largest of the upper Connecticut River watershed.[15] St. Johnsbury is on the site of the northernmost boundary of Lake Hitchcock, the post-glacial predecessor to the Connecticut River. The town includes the unincorporated villages of St. Johnsbury, East St. Johnsbury, Goss Hollow, and St. Johnsbury Center.[16] The town center, which is defined as a census-designated place (CDP), encompasses the villages of St. Johnsbury and St. Johnsbury Center and covers an area of 13.1 square miles (33.9 km2), about 36% of the area of the town.[17] The highest point in St. Johnsbury is an unnamed hill in the northwest part of town east of Libby Road. The twin summits of the hill each rise above 1,594 feet (486 m) above sea level.[18] Climate[edit] On February 25, 1969, St. Johnsbury received 33 inches (84 cm) of snow, the greatest daily snowfall for any location in Vermont.[19] Climate data for St. Johnsbury, Vermont Month Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Year Record high °F (°C) 63 (17) 62 (17) 84 (29) 92 (33) 94 (34) 98 (37) 99 (37) 98 (37) 95 (35) 89 (32) 77 (25) 67 (19) 99 (37) Average high °F (°C) 27.6 (−2.4) 32.0 (0.0) 42.4 (5.8) 55.9 (13.3) 69.9 (21.1) 77.1 (25.1) 80.8 (27.1) 78.2 (25.7) 69.3 (20.7) 57.6 (14.2) 43.4 (6.3) 31.5 (−0.3) 55.5 (13.1) Average low °F (°C) 6.4 (−14.2) 8.3 (−13.2) 19.6 (−6.9) 31.1 (−0.5) 42.7 (5.9) 52.1 (11.2) 56.8 (13.8) 55.4 (13.0) 47.4 (8.6) 36.4 (2.4) 27.6 (−2.4) 13.7 (−10.2) 33.1 (0.6) Record low °F (°C) −35 (−37) −43 (−42) −27 (−33) −2 (−19) 20 (−7) 30 (−1) 36 (2) 33 (1) 22 (−6) 13 (−11) −13 (−25) −42 (−41) −43 (−42) Average precipitation inches (mm) 2.88 (73) 2.04 (52) 2.57 (65) 2.74 (70) 3.35 (85) 3.88 (99) 3.84 (98) 4.21 (107) 3.47 (88) 3.24 (82) 3.32 (84) 3.00 (76) 38.54 (979) Average snowfall inches (cm) 22.7 (58) 16.8 (43) 15.1 (38) 5.3 (13) 0.2 (0.51) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0.1 (0.25) 0.6 (1.5) 6.6 (17) 20.8 (53) 88.2 (224.26) Source: NOAA[20] Demographics[edit] North Congregational Church on Main Street Historical population Census Pop. %± 1790 143 — 1800 663 363.6% 1810 1,334 101.2% 1820 1,404 5.2% 1830 1,592 13.4% 1840 1,887 18.5% 1850 2,758 46.2% 1860 3,469 25.8% 1870 4,665 34.5% 1880 5,800 24.3% 1890 6,567 13.2% 1900 7,010 6.7% 1910 8,098 15.5% 1920 8,708 7.5% 1930 9,696 11.3% 1940 9,095 −6.2% 1950 9,292 2.2% 1960 8,869 −4.6% 1970 8,409 −5.2% 1980 7,938 −5.6% 1990 7,608 −4.2% 2000 7,571 −0.5% 2010 7,604 0.4% Est. 2018 7,204 [21] −5.3% U.S. Decennial Census[22] As of the census of 2010,[2] there were 7,604 people, 3,236 households, and 1,917 families residing in the town.

Education[edit] St. Johnsbury Academy - Colby Hall St. Johnsbury Academy is a private high school founded by the Fairbanks family in 1842. The town of St. Johnsbury does not operate a public school for grades 9-12, but Vermont law requires towns not operating schools to pay tuition to other approved schools for students in the grades not provided, an amount up to the Average Announced Tuition for union schools.[23] A majority of St. Johnsbury secondary school students choose to be educated at St. Johnsbury Academy at the town's expense. St. Johnsbury Trade School opened in September 1918, offering the only four year vocational education in the area. The school's founders, Fairbanks, Morse and Company, wanted to provide young people with the opportunity to learn a trade while providing them a base for earning more money and high school courses.[24] After serving the community for over 50 years, the Trade School was closed, and the building then became the junior high. In 1981, it became the St. Johnsbury Middle School.[25] After consolidating the local school system, the old trade school became the site of the St. Johnsbury School serving students from k-8th grade. St. Johnsbury School now serves pre-kindergarten through 8th grade. Good Shepherd School is operated by St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church and serves pre-school through 8th grade. Government[edit] Fire department[edit] St. Johnsbury Fire Station with two fire engines In 2010, the town employed ten firefighters. The department had an annual budget of $945,920. It has had a professional department since about 1910.[26] Social services[edit] Social services are provided in part by Northeast Kingdom Community Action located here and in other Northeast Kingdom sites. Economy[edit] Industry[edit] Caledonia Superior Court on Main Street E.T. & H.K. Ide Company, a grain wholesaler founded in 1813, was the oldest continuously operating business in town when the family sold it in 2003. It is no longer operational.[27] Fairbanks Scales, precision machinery and manufacturing company still in business after more than 190 years, employs 160 workers.[28] Maple Grove Farms of Vermont was founded by Katharine Ide Gray in 1915. It is the largest packer of pure maple syrup in the United States.[29][30] In 2006, they employed 100 and had sales of $75 million. They are a subsidiary of B&G Foods.[31] Retail[edit] Green Mountain Mall is a shopping mall north of downtown St. Johnsbury on U.S. Route 5.[32] The anchor store is JCPenney. Medical[edit] The Northeast Kingdom Human Services aids mental health needs. The Northeastern Vermont Regional Hospital is located in the town. Culture[edit] The St. Johnsbury Athenaeum is the only National Historic Landmark in the Northeast Kingdom. St. Johnsbury is the home of the Fairbanks Museum & Planetarium which opened in 1891 as a gift of Franklin Fairbanks, a businessman, naturalist and philanthropist, to the community. His donated collections remain northern New England’s most extensive natural history display, and the National Register-listed building is a splendid example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style. The Fairbanks Museum is well known in Vermont for producing the "Eye on the Sky" weather forecast which is broadcast on Vermont Public Radio. There has been an annual First Night community celebration of the arts on New Year's Eve since 1993.[33] The town contains the only National Historic Landmark in the county, as well as the only one in the Northeast Kingdom - the St. Johnsbury Athenaeum. The town also contains 12 other places on the list of National Register of Historic Places, the most in Caledonia County or the Northeast Kingdom: Benoit Apartment House-74 Pearl Street (added June 6, 1994) Benoit Apartment House-76 Pearl Street (added June 6, 1994) Caleb H.
