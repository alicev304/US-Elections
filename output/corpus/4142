Barron Trump in August 2019 Barron William Trump (born March 20, 2006)[8] is Donald Trump's youngest child and his only child with Melania Trump.

In May 2006, Barron Trump was baptized at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida.[9][10] He attended the Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School in Manhattan. Barron is fluent in English and Slovene.[11] During his early childhood, Barron made several television appearances, including on The Apprentice and a May 16, 2006, episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show at only two months old.[12] Barron did not immediately move into the White House when his father became president, but remained at Trump Tower with his mother until the end of the 2016–2017 school year.[13] Melania and Barron moved to the White House on June 11, 2017. He now attends St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland.[14] He made few appearances during the 2016 election.[15] He made a total of three public appearances on the campaign trail, appearing at a campaign rally in South Carolina, and attending his father's RNC acceptance speech and presidential victory speech.[16] While absent from pre-inauguration events, he was at his father's inauguration ceremony in January 2017 and some of the subsequent events.[17] Barron is noted to be a fan of soccer.

Johann Trump, born in Bobenheim in 1789, moved to the nearby village of Kallstadt where his grandson, Friedrich Trump, the grandfather of Donald Trump, was born in 1869.[34][35] This German heritage was long concealed by Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, who had grown up in a mainly German-speaking environment until he was ten years old;[36] after World War II and until the 1980s, he told people he was of Swedish ancestry.[37] Donald Trump repeated this version in The Art of the Deal (1987) but later said he is "proud" of his German heritage, and served as grand marshal of the 1999 German-American Steuben Parade in New York City.[38][39] v t e Select family tree of the Trump family Fred Trump 1905–1999 Mary Anne MacLeod 1912–2000 Maryanne Trump 1937–present Fred Trump Jr. 1938–1981 Elizabeth Trump 1942–present Robert Trump 1948–present Marla Maples 1963–present Donald Trump 1946–present Ivana Zelníčková 1949–present Melanija Knavs 1970–present Tiffany Trump 1993–present Vanessa Haydon 1977–present Donald Trump Jr. 1977–present Jared Kushner 1981–present Ivanka Trump 1981–present Eric Trump 1984–present Lara Yunaska 1982–present Barron Trump 2006–present Kai Trump 2007–present Donald Trump III 2009–present Tristan Trump 2011–present Spencer Trump 2012–present Chloe Trump 2014–present Arabella Kushner 2011–present Joseph Kushner 2013–present Theodore Kushner 2016–present Eric Trump Jr. 2017–present Carolina Trump 2019–present Notes: Parents Fred Trump Main article: Fred Trump Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump (1905–1999), born in New York, was a successful real estate developer in New York City.[40][41] Using his inheritance, Fred Trump and his mother Elizabeth founded Elizabeth Trump & Son. Donald Trump later renamed it The Trump Organization and served as its chairman and president until assuming the office of U.S. president.[42] Mary Anne MacLeod Trump Main article: Mary Anne MacLeod Trump Further information: MacLeod Born as Mary Anne MacLeod (1912–2000) in Tong, a small village near Stornoway, in the Western Isles of Scotland, she was the daughter of fisherman Malcolm MacLeod and Mary MacLeod (née Smith).[43] At age 17, she immigrated to the United States and started working as a maid in New York.[43] Mary and Donald Trump's father Fred Trump met in New York and married in 1936, settling together in Queens. Mary became a U.S. citizen in 1942.[43][44] Donald Trump has said he "feels Scottish".[38][39] Grandparents Frederick Trump Main article: Frederick Trump In 1885, Donald Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, emigrated from Kallstadt, Palatinate (then part of the Kingdom of Bavaria), to the United States at age 16. He anglicized his name to Frederick in 1892 when he became a U.S. citizen.[40] During the Klondike Gold Rush, he amassed a fortune by opening a restaurant and hotel in Bennett and later Whitehorse, serving gold seekers on their way to the region; one biographer wrote that the business included a brothel, a portrayal Donald Trump has said was "totally false".[45] After his death, his fortune was passed on to his wife and son. Frederick Trump was a second cousin of Henry J. Heinz, founder of H. J. Heinz Company, whose father also came from Kallstadt. Elizabeth Christ Trump Further information: Christ (surname) and Hartung Donald Trump's grandmother, Elizabeth Christ Trump, née Christ, was born in 1880 and died on June 6, 1966. Born Elisabeth Christ, she married Frederick Trump in 1902 and moved to the United States with him. Like her husband, she was a native of Kallstadt, born as the daughter of Philipp and Marie Christ. Philipp Christ was descended from Johannes Christ (1626–1688/9) of Flörsheim, Hesse. Elizabeth Christ Trump was a descendant of organ builder Johann Michael Hartung (1708–1763) through her paternal grandmother Sabina Christ.[46] Siblings Maryanne Trump Barry Maryanne Barry (born 1937) is Donald Trump's eldest sister. She was a senior federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals,[47] became inactive in 2017 after her brother took office, and retired in 2019.[48] Fred Trump Jr. Fred Trump Jr. (1938–1981) was Donald Trump's older brother. While attending Lehigh University, he joined a Jewish fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, even though he was not Jewish. After he graduated, he was unable to work with his father in his family business, so he flew planes for Trans World Airlines.[49] In 1962 he married Linda Clapp and had two children with her, Fred and Mary, before their eventual divorce.[50] In September 1981, at the age of 42, he died from a heart attack as a result of his alcoholism.[51] His death caused Donald Trump to avoid alcohol and cigarettes.[50][52] In an August 2019 interview with The Washington Post, Donald Trump opened up about his relationship with his late brother and expressed regret over how he treated Fred Jr. and his struggle with alcoholism. Trump said Freddy's memory still shapes his life to this day, and had a huge impact on the trajectory of his own business career and life. In the interview Donald Trump said, "He was so handsome, and I saw what alcohol did to him even physically ... and that had an impact on me, too."[53] Elizabeth Trump Grau Elizabeth Trump Grau (born 1942) is an older sister of Donald Trump.[54] In 1989, she married film producer James Grau.[55] She worked as an executive for Chase Manhattan Bank, before retiring to Florida.[56][57] Robert Trump Robert Trump (born 1948) is Donald Trump's younger brother.[58] He is a business executive and real estate developer who managed the Trump Organization's real estate holdings outside Manhattan.[59][60] He was married to Blaine Trump[61] until their divorce in 2007.[62] He serves on the board of directors for ZeniMax Media.[63] He is president of Trump Management, a company of which a trust fund benefiting Donald J. Trump owns 25% while the balance is owned by Trump family members. He is an investor in SHiRT LLC, one of two owners of Virginia-based CertiPath.[64] Other relatives John G.

Van de Graaff, one of the first million-volt X-ray generators. He was a recipient of Ronald Reagan's National Medal of Science and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.
