He insists there are no conflicts of interest because his work for Trump is pro bono, and no need to register as a foreign agent because he does not lobby the government, though some lobbying experts disagree.[21] July 11: Brian Benczkowski is controversially confirmed as a US Assistant Attorney General and head of the Criminal Division, which is under Rosenstein's purview. Benczkowski has no prosecutorial experience.[22] After working for the Trump transition team, he worked for Alfa-Bank in 2017, defending it against accusations of suspicious contacts with a Trump Organization server in 2016.[23] July 12: The White House orders that all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees be given access to classified materials related to the FBI informant who contacted Papadopoulos and Page in 2016.

The indictment also alleges three of the officers hacked into election systems and stole many voters' personal information.[26][27] Leaders of the Maryland legislature reveal that ByteGrid LLC, which operates some of the state's election systems, is owned by Russian oligarch Vladimir Potanin.

At a joint press conference afterward, Trump says in his opening statement, “During today's meeting, I addressed directly with President Putin the issue of Russian interference in our elections.” Putin says in his statement, "...the Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs, including the election process." Jeff Mason from Reuters asks Putin why Americans should believe him. Trump jumps in and talks about his electoral college win and denies collusion with Russia. Putin responds, "As to who is to be believed and to who is not to be believed, you can trust no one, if you take this." Jonathan Lemire from AP asks Trump if he believes Putin or his own intelligence officials on whether Russia interfered in the election. Trump responds by asking about a Pakistani working for the DNC and Clinton's emails, and calls into question the FBI's investigation of hacked DNC servers. He concludes, "So I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today."[34] Mason also asked Putin, "President Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?" and Putin responded, "Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal". This exchange is missing from the official transcripts and video of the summit for ten days before being added.[35][36][37][38] July 17: Prosecutors file an indictment of Butina in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.[39] Rohrabacher tells Politico he is unsure whether he is the U.S. congressman mentioned in the Butina indictment, though he admits to being in Russia in August 2015 and dining with Butina and another congressman. He calls the charges against Butina "bogus" and a function of the "deep state."[40] July 18: Butina pleads not guilty at a preliminary hearing. The judge orders Butina be held without bail pending trial.[41] The New York Times reports that Trump was shown evidence that Putin personally ordered the 2016 hacking of DNC servers in a January 6, 2017, intelligence briefing.[42] CNN reports that the Secret Service has been blocking the DNC's attempts to serve Jared Kushner with the lawsuit it filed against him in April.[43] Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee interview Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, George Papadopolous's wife, for four hours.

The articles say Rosenstein should have recused himself from overseeing the Mueller investigation because he signed the FISA warrant applications for surveilling Carter Page, and accuse Rosenstein of withholding documents from Congress.[55][56] House speaker Paul Ryan opposes the articles and convinces Meadows and Jordan not to try to force a floor vote.[57] Senator Chuck Grassley asks Gubarev's lawyers in a letter to provide a copy of the Steele deposition to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Steele was deposed in London on June 18 as part of Gubarev's libel suit against BuzzFeed.[58][59] July 26: CNN reports that Cohen claims that Trump was informed by Donald Trump Jr. of the Russians' offer of dirt on Hillary Clinton in advance of the 2016 June 9 meeting with Veselnitskaya, contradicting claims by Trump and Trump Jr. that Trump only learned of the meeting shortly before it was reported by the New York Times in July 2017.[60] The Wall Street Journal reports that longtime Trump Organization finance executive Allen Weisselberg has been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Cohen's ongoing criminal investigation.[61] The Daily Beast reports that Senator Claire McCaskill's reelection campaign was targeted by Fancy Bear for a phishing attack in August 2017.

He says that if the House votes to impeach Rosenstein, the Senate will have to drop everything, including consideration of Kavanaugh, until they vote on the impeachment, and putting Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is more important than removing Rosenstein. Nunes also tells the audience that it is illegal for a candidate to use stolen emails in their campaign. The fundraiser is a private event that excludes the press, but an attendee secretly records Nunes's comments and gives the recording to MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show.[66] July 31: Paul Manafort's trial for bank and tax fraud charges starts in Alexandria, Virginia.[67] Facebook announces they have shut down eight pages, 17 profiles, and seven Instagram accounts related to "bad actors" identified recently with activity profiles similar to the IRA. The company says it doesn't have enough information to attribute the accounts, groups, and events to the IRA, but that a known IRA account was briefly an administrator of the "Resisters" group.[68] The "Resisters" group was the first organizer on Facebook of the upcoming "No Unite The Right 2 – DC" protest scheduled in Washington, D.C., for August 10. Some of the event's other organizers insist they started organizing before "Resisters" created the event's Facebook page.[69] Andrew Miller, a former associate of Roger Stone, loses his attempt to challenge a subpoena from Mueller by asserting Mueller's appointment was unconstitutional. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell rules Mueller's appointment was constitutional and that the subpoena is therefore valid and Miller must appear "at the earliest date available to the grand jury, and to complete production of the subpoenaed records promptly."[70] August[edit] Further information: Trials of Paul Manafort, 2018 August 1: CNN reports that over the past few months Mueller referred three people and their firms to the U.S. Attorney for the SDNY for further investigation into failing to register as lobbyists for a foreign government. The referrals include Tony Podesta, former U.S. Representative Vin Weber (MN-R), and former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig. Manafort paid all three, and their firms, through the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine to lobby on behalf of the Ukrainian government. Craig worked at the same firm as Alex van der Zwaan.[71][72] Trump makes a series of tweets related to Manafort,[73][74][15]:125 including calling for Sessions to end the Mueller investigation immediately[75] and complaining that Manafort is being treated worse than Al Capone.[76] His tweets are widely reported in the press, and, in 2019, the Mueller Report cites them as evidence of attempted jury tampering.[15]:125, 131–132 The Senate votes to allow the Senate Intelligence Committee to share the transcript of Butina's testimony before the committee with the prosecutorial and defense teams in her criminal case.[77] Mueller's team interviews Kristin M.

The meeting allegedly took place at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, months before WikiLeaks released Democratic emails stolen by Russian intelligence officers.[234] Manafort denies the report.[235] Corsi releases a draft plea agreement showing Stone tasked him in the summer of 2016 with finding out what damaging information WikiLeaks had on Clinton.[187] The New York Times reports that Manafort's lawyer repeatedly briefed Trump's lawyers on Manafort's discussions with Mueller's team after he agreed to cooperate.[235][15]:127 Mueller's team interviews Dmitri Klimentov.

Why would I take it off the table?"[238][15]:128 November 29: Criminal Information document filed with Michael Cohen's November 29 plea agreement Cohen pleads guilty in SDNY to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate deal involving Trump. The case was brought by Mueller's investigators directly, unlike the August case in which Cohen pleaded guilty in the same court.[239] In the criminal information document filed with the plea agreement, Trump is identified as "Individual 1",[240] Felix Sater as "Individual 2",[240] and Dmitry Peskov as "Russian Official 1".[241] BuzzFeed News reports that in 2016 the Trump Organization planned to give Putin the $50 million penthouse in the proposed Trump Tower Moscow.[242] Trump admits[243] for the first time that he was pursuing a business deal in Moscow during the presidential campaign. He repeatedly denied any such dealings since announcing his candidacy.[244][245] The Maryland State Board of Elections releases a report detailing the United States Department of Homeland Security's investigation into the integrity of the state's election systems. The investigation was triggered by the July 13 revelation that ByteGrid, Maryland's election systems supplier, was purchased by a Russian oligarch without the state being informed of the change in ownership. No evidence of malicious activity was found, but the state changed providers anyway as a precautionary measure.[246][247] November 30: The prosecution announces at Manafort's preliminary sentencing hearing in Washington, D.C., that it is considering more charges against Manafort and may retry him on the charges the jury was unable to agree on in his trial.[248][249] The Central Bank of Russia announces Torshin has retired from his position as Deputy Governor.[250] November 30 – December 3: Nunes and his aides Derek Harvey, Scott Glabe, and George Pappas travel to Europe to investigate the origins of the Mueller investigation.

Manafort later lied under oath about his interactions.[252][253] December 1: Cohen's lawyers file his sentencing memorandum, in which they ask the court for no prison time because of his cooperation with federal investigators.[254] December 3: Trump attacks Cohen on Twitter for asking for no prison time, calling him a liar and accusing him of making a deal to protect his wife and father-in-law from prosecution.[255] In 2019, The Mueller Report refers to these tweets as evidence of witness intimidation.[15]:151, 154, 156 Mueller's team complains to Trump's personal counsel in writing that Trump's responses submitted on November 20 were insufficient, including more than 30 questions answered with "does not 'recall' or 'remember' or have an 'independent recollection'" of the requested information. They again ask for an in-person interview with Trump.[15]:C-1 December 4: In a sentencing memorandum, the Mueller investigation says Michael Flynn "deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government" and should receive little or no jail time.[256] Sentencing memorandum for Michael Cohen filed by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). December 6: Mother Jones reports that the Trump campaign and the NRA both used National Media Research, Planning and Placement (NMRPP) to buy political ads in 2016, often with the same NMRPP employee buying ads for both Trump and the NRA for the same dates, television stations, and television shows. Former Federal Election Commission chair Ann Ravel tells Mother Jones, "I don’t think I’ve ever seen a situation where illegal coordination seems more obvious. It is so blatant that it doesn’t even seem sloppy. Everyone involved probably just thinks there aren’t going to be any consequences."[257] December 7: Mueller files a sentencing memorandum for Manafort in D.C. federal court.[258] Mueller and federal prosecutors from the SDNY file sentencing memoranda for Cohen in Manhattan federal court.[259] The SDNY memorandum effectively accuses Trump of defrauding voters.[260] In the memorandum, Trump is identified as "Individual-1",[261] Karen McDougal as "Woman-1",[261] Stephanie Clifford as "Woman-2",[261] the Trump Organization as "Company",[262] the National Enquirer as "Magazine-1",[262] Pecker as "Chairman-1",[262] and American Media, Inc. as "Corporation-1".[262] In one of the filings, Cohen spoke of a Russian "trusted person" in the Russian Federation who could offer the Trump campaign "political synergy" and "synergy on a government level."[263] Comey testifies for seven hours before the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees behind closed doors. He tells the committees that in 2016 the FBI opened investigations into four Americans to determine if they were involved in the Russian election interference. He says some of the four were associated with the Trump campaign, but that Trump himself is not among them.[264] WikiLeaks, the Trump campaign, Kushner, Papadopoulos, and Stone file motions to dismiss the April 2018 DNC lawsuit against them. WikiLeaks argues the suit should be dismissed because it did not participate in hacking the DNC, and its publication of the DNC's material is protected by the First amendment. The Trump campaign argues the suit should be dismissed because it seeks to "explain away [the DNC] candidate’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election" and fails to show the campaign "aided and abetted Russia." Kushner's filing argues the suit should be dismissed because he had no prior knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting. Papadopoulos and Stone's filings cast their roles as innocuous. None of the filings contest the events the DNC laid out in its suit.[265] The Campaign Legal Center and Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence file a joint complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging the NRA and the Trump campaign illegally coordinated ad buys in 2016.[266] Papadopoulos completes his term of imprisonment and is released from prison.[15]:D-6 Transcript of Comey testimony before the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees December 8: The House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees release the transcript of the prior day's Comey testimony.[264] December 10: Corsi files a $350 million lawsuit against Mueller, the Justice Department, the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA for allegedly illegally searching Corsi's phone and text messages without a warrant or probable cause.[267] December 11: The sentencing hearing in the Manafort case in D.C. begins, and is then postponed until January.[268] CNN reports that Butina agreed to plead guilty to spying and is now cooperating with the prosecutor.[269] December 12: Former Trump attorney Cohen is sentenced to three years in prison.[270] Federal prosecutors from SDNY unseal a non-prosecution agreement entered into on September 20 with American Media, Inc., that gives the company immunity from prosecution in exchange for its help in investigating a payment it made to McDougal at the direction of Trump.[182] New York Attorney General-elect Letitia James tells NBC News that she plans to investigate Trump, his family, and associates. Her investigations will include potentially illegal real estate dealings, the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, government subsidies received by Trump, potential emoluments clause violations through his businesses, and the Trump Foundation. Her ability to investigate may hinge upon the passage of a bill by the State of New York that would allow her to bring prosecutions under New York law for acts that are pardoned under federal law.[271] Reuters reports that Putin is unclear about why Butina was arrested. He said, "She risks 15 years in jail. For what? I asked all the heads of our intelligence services what is going on. Nobody knows anything about her."[272] Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis tells Bloomberg that Trump and the White House knew in advance that Cohen was going to lie to Congress and did nothing to dissuade him from doing so.[273] The Kiev Administrative District Court rules that National Anti-Corruption Bureau director Artem Sytnyk and member of the Ukrainian Parliament Serhiy Leshchenko acted illegally when they revealed that Manafort's name and signature were in Yanukovych's "black ledger".[274][275] The court rules that their actions "led to interference in the electoral processes of the United States in 2016 and harmed the interests of Ukraine as a state."[274] Leshchenko responds in a Facebook post that the real purpose of the ruling is to help Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko ingratiate himself with Trump.[274] The ruling was on a lawsuit brought by fellow member of parliament Boryslav Rozenblat of the Poroshenko Bloc party.[275] On July 16, 2019, the decision is overturned by the Sixth Administrative Court of Appeal.[275] Trump declines Mueller's team's in-person interview request made on December 3.[15]:C-2 Maria Butina statement of the offense. December 13: Butina pleads guilty in a D.C. federal court to trying to infiltrate the U.S. conservative movement as an agent for the Kremlin. She admits to working with Erickson to forge bonds with NRA officials and conservative leaders while under the direction of Torshin. In her plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to drop a charge of failing to register as a foreign agent in exchange for cooperation. In the statement of the offense, Erickson is identified as "U.S. Person 1", Torshin as the "Russian Official", the Republican Party as "Political Party #1", and the NRA as the "Gun Rights Organization".[276] The Wall Street Journal and NBC News report that Trump, Cohen, and Pecker met in August 2015 and agreed that Pecker would seek out and suppress any negative stories about Trump.[277] The Wall Street Journal reports that the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office has started investigating the Trump inaugural committee for misspending money, or, possibly selling access to the incoming Trump administration to get policy concessions or influence Trump administration positions.[278] Trump denies directing Cohen to break the law in a tweet, and tells Fox News the charges against Cohen were cooked up to "embarrass" him.[279][280] Trump tweets that "[he] never directed Michael Cohen to break the law," that Cohen plead guilty to "embarrass the president" and protect his family from prosecution, and finishes with, "As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!"[281] In 2019, The Mueller Report refers to these tweets as evidence of witness intimidation.[15]:151, 154, 156 December 14: An entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., is sealed off for a closed-door hearing involving an unidentified foreign government-owned company challenging a subpoena for Mueller's grand jury.[282][283] Cohen tells George Stephanopoulos in an ABC News interview that Trump knew it was wrong to pay McDougal and Clifford.[284] Federal prosecutors file a motion asking a judge for permission to move Butina to and from the Alexandria City Jail for interviews and, potentially, to testify before a grand jury. Intended to be under seal, the motion is briefly posted to the court website before being removed.[285] December 16: Trump attacks Cohen on Twitter, calling him a "Rat" for cooperating with the FBI.[286] In 2019, The Mueller Report refers to this tweet as evidence of witness intimidation.[15]:151, 154 Indictment of Bijan Kian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin unsealed on December 17, 2018. The IRA, Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States, 2012-2018 The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency December 17 Federal prosecutors unseal an indictment against Bijan Kian and Kamil Ekim Alptekin, charging them both with conspiracy and acting as unregistered agents of a foreign government. Alptekin is also charged with making false statements. Kian is Flynn's business partner in Flynn Intel Group, and Alptekin hired the Group on behalf of the Turkish government to influence opinion in the U.S. and facilitate the extradition of Fethullah Gülen.[287] In the indictment, Flynn is identified as "Person A",[287] Flynn Intel Group as "Company A",[287] Inovo BV as "Company "B",[288] Gülen as "Turkish citizen",[287] President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as "Senior Turkish Leader #1",[287] Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım as "Senior Turkish Leader #2",[289] and, in no particular order, Energy Minister Berat Albayrak and Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu as "Turkish Minister #1" and "Turkish Minister #2".[290] Reports indicate there are strong hints Flynn was a contributing cooperator.[291] Mueller's team releases the FBI notes on the interview with Flynn on January 24, 2017.[292] The Senate Intelligence Committee releases two reports it commissioned on the social media activities of the IRA: "The Tactics & Tropes of the Internet Research Agency" and "The IRA, Social Media and Political Polarization in the United States, 2012-2018".[293] D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling: the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not protect a company owned by a foreign country from a grand jury subpoena. December 18: Bijan pleads not guilty in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia. A spokesperson for Alptekin tells the court that he denies any wrongdoing.[294] Michael Flynn's sentencing is delayed for 90 days as Judge Emmet Sullivan accuses Flynn of possible treason and states that he "sold out his country.".[295] The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds the grand jury subpoena that was argued over in a December 14 closed-door hearing that drew the attention of the press because security cleared the entire floor of the courthouse during the proceedings. The court rules that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act does not immunize a corporation owned by a foreign country even if the subpoena violates that country's laws.[296][297][283] After acting attorney general Whitaker consults Justice Department ethics officials multiple times, the officials tell a group of Whitaker's advisers that he should recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.[298] December 19: In a Moscow news briefing, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says that Butina was coerced into making a false confession: "Butina confirmed that she had done a deal with U.S. investigators and confessed to being a foreign agent. Having created unbearable conditions for her and threatening her with a long jail sentence, she was literally forced to sign up to absolutely ridiculous charges."[299] US District Judge Ursula Ungaro dismisses Aleksej Gubarev's February 2017 defamation lawsuit against BuzzFeed News. Gubarev claimed Buzzfeed News defamed him by publishing unproven statements about him in the Steele dossier.

Attorney General Karl Racine sues Facebook over its involvement with Cambridge Analytica.[301] The Wall Street Journal reports that sworn depositions by Trump show that he has extensive knowledge of campaign finance laws.

The court ordered Mueller to respond by December 31.[310] December 27 McClatchy DC reports that Cohen's cellphone communicated with cell towers in the Prague area in late summer 2016, lending credence to allegations in the Steele dossier. They also report that an Eastern European intelligence agency overheard a Russian conversation in late August/early September that included remarks saying Cohen was in Prague. Cohen denies the story, but McClatchy insists the information came from four independent sources.[311] The 2019 Mueller Report states that Cohen never traveled to Prague.[15]:139 Eric Dubelier, a lawyer defending Concord Management and Consulting,[312] who earlier asked the court to lift the prohibition from sharing discovery information with his client in Russia, files a motion to prevent Mueller from providing classified information to the judge that justifies the restriction. Mueller has provided Dubelier with 4 million pages from email and social media accounts belonging to Russian trolls, and asserts that sharing 3.2 million of those pages with Dubelier's clients in Russia would compromise intelligence gathering techniques.[313] Mueller's team asks U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon to postpone the scheduled January 3, 2019, hearing for the December 10 lawsuit Corsi filed against Mueller, the FBI, and other government agencies because of the government shutdown.
