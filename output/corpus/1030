List of governors of Connecticut From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Connecticut) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Connecticut Seal of the Governor Incumbent Ned Lamont since January 9, 2019 Style His Excellency Residence Connecticut Governor's Residence Term length Four years Inaugural holder Jonathan Trumbull Deputy Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut Salary $150,000 (2013)[1] (Governor Lamont has declined a salary)[2] Website Office of the Governor The Governor of Connecticut is the elected head of the executive branch of Connecticut's state government, and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Connecticut General Assembly and to convene the legislature.[3] Unusual among U.S. governors, the Governor of Connecticut has no power to pardon.[4] The Governor of Connecticut is automatically a member of the state's Bonding Commission. He is an ex-officio member of the Board of Trustees of the University of Connecticut and Yale University. There have been 68 post-Revolution governors of the state, serving 72 distinct spans in office. The longest terms in office were in the state's early years, when four governors were elected to nine or more one-year terms. The longest was that of the first governor, Jonathan Trumbull, who served over 14 years, but 7 of those as colonial governor; the longest-serving state governor — with no other position included in the term — was his son, Jonathan Trumbull Jr., who served over 11 years. The shortest term was that of Hiram Bingham III, who served only one day before resigning to take an elected seat in the U.S. Senate. Lowell Weicker, is noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing A Connecticut Party. The current governor is Ned Lamont, a Democrat who took office on January 9, 2019. Contents 1 Governors 2 Succession 3 Notes 4 References 5 External links Governors[edit] For the period before independence, see the list of colonial governors of Connecticut. Connecticut was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and was admitted as a state on January 9, 1788.[5] Before it declared its independence, Connecticut was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. Connecticut did not create a state constitution for itself until several decades after it became a state; until 1818, the state operated under the provisions of its colonial charter. The charter called for the election of a governor every year, but not more than once every two years, with the term commencing on the second Thursday in May.[6] The current Constitution of Connecticut, ratified in 1965, calls for a four-year term for the governor,[7] commencing on the Wednesday after the first Monday in the January following an election.[8] The previous constitution of 1818 originally had only a one-year term for governor; this was increased to two years in 1875,[9] and four years in 1948.[10] The 1875 amendment also set the start date of the term to its current date; before then, it was the first Wednesday in the May following an election.[11] The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket; this provision was added in 1962.[12] In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.[13] Before the adoption of the 1965 constitution, the lieutenant governor only acted as governor.[14] There is no limit of any kind on the number of terms one may serve.

So, as colonial governor, Jonathan Trumbull became state governor, serving roughly 14 years total.[16] ^ Represented the Democratic-Republican Party ^ a b Represented the National Republican Party ^ Tomlinson resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[19] ^ The constitutional start date for the term in 1850 was May 1; the delay may be because Seymour was chosen by the legislature after a close election.[20] ^ Seymour resigned to be U.S. Minister to Russia.[20] ^ a b James English won the popular vote, but a canvassing committee found the election was fraudulent, and named Jewell governor several days into the term.[21] ^ This term was lengthened by 7 months due to a constitutional amendment moving the election schedule.[9] ^ First term under a constitutional amendment which lengthened terms to two years.[9] ^ The constitutional start date for the term in 1879 was January 8; the delay may be because Andrews was chosen by the legislature after a close election.[22][23] ^ The constitutional start date for the term in 1885 was January 7; the delay may be because Harrison was chosen by the legislature after a close election.[24] ^ The constitutional start date for the term in 1887 was January 5; the delay may be because Lounsbury was chosen by the legislature after a close election.[25] ^ The constitutional start date for the term in 1889 was January 9; the delay may be because Bulkeley was chosen by the legislature after a close election.[26] ^ Morgan Bulkeley did not run for re-election in 1890, but due to such a close contest and controversies, the results were not certified, and the legislature spent two years debating the issue; Bulkeley essentially served as governor by default.[26] ^ a b c Represented the Republican Party ^ Bingham resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[27] ^ Since Trumbull took over only one day into the term, nearly all sources describe J. Edwin Brainard as lieutenant governor during this term; however, constitutionally, he would have remained president of the senate and only acted as lieutenant governor. At least one contemporary news source describes him as such.[28] ^ Baldwin resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[29] ^ a b Represented the Democratic Party ^ Robert E. Parsons is always listed as serving as lieutenant governor during this term, but constitutionally he likely would have remained president of the senate. However, questions were raised over whether or not they should fully succeed to the next office.[30] ^ First term under a constitution amendment which lengthened terms to four years.[10] ^ Ribicoff resigned to become United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.[31] ^ Anthony J. Armentano is always listed as serving as lieutenant governor during this term, but constitutionally he likely would have remained president of the senate. This is the last time such a confusion would exist, as the 1965 constitution established a solid line of succession. ^ Grasso resigned due to ovarian cancer.[32] ^ Rowland resigned due to a federal corruption investigation;[33] he later pleaded guilty to corruption.[34] ^ Lamont's first term expires on January 4, 2023.
