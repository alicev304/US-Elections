Advances in technology and media have also affected presidential campaigns. The invention of radio and then television gave way to the reliance of national political advertisements such as Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 "[[Daisy (advertisement)|Daisy]]", Ronald Reagan's 1984 "[[Morning in America]]", and George H. W. Bush's 1988 "[[Revolving Door (advertisement)|Revolving Door]]", all of which became major factors. In 1992, George H. W. Bush's promise of "[[Read my lips: no new taxes]]" was extensively used in the commercials of Bill Clinton and Bush's other opponents with significant effect during the campaign.

Since the development of the internet in the mid-90s, [[Internet activism]] has also become an invaluable component of presidential campaigns, especially since 2000. The internet was first used in the 1996 presidential elections, but primarily as a brochure for the candidate online.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009">{{cite journal|last1=Pollard|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Chesebro|first2=James W.|last3=Studinski|first3=David Paul|title=The Role of the Internet in Presidential Campaigns|journal=Communications Studies|year=2009|volume=60|issue=5|pages=574–88|doi=10.1080/10510970903260418}}</ref> It was only used by a few candidates and there is no evidence of any major effect on the outcomes of that election cycle.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

In 2000, both candidates (George W. Bush and [[Al Gore]]) created, maintained and updated campaign websites. But it was not until the 2004 presidential election cycle was the potential value of the internet seen. By the summer of 2003, ten people competing in the 2004 presidential election had developed campaign websites.<ref name=Endres>{{cite journal|last=Endres, Warnick|title=Text-based Interactivity in Candidate Campaign Web Sites: A case Study from the 2002 Elections|journal=Western Journal of Communication|year=2004|volume=68|issue=3|pages=322–42|doi=10.1080/10570310409374804}}</ref> [[Howard Dean 2004 presidential campaign|Howard Dean's]] campaign website from that year was considered a model for all future campaign websites. His website played a significant role in his overall campaign strategy.<ref name=Endres/> It allowed his supporters to read about his campaign platform and provide feedback, donate, get involved with the campaign, and connect with other supporters.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/> A [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll from January 2004 revealed that 49 percent of Americans have used the internet to get information about candidates, and 28 percent said they use the internet to get this information frequently.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

Use of the [[Internet]] for [[grassroots fundraising]] by US presidential candidates such as [[Howard Dean]], [[Barack Obama]], [[Ron Paul]] and [[Bernie Sanders]] established it as an effective political tool. In 2016, the use of [[social media]] was a key part of [[Donald Trump]] campaign. Trump and his opinions were established as constantly “trending” by posting multiple times per day, and his strong online influence was constantly reinforced.<ref name=diggit>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.diggitmagazine.com/articles/Trump-Twitter-Based-Presidency|title=Trump, social media and the first Twitter-based Presidency|date=July 5, 2018|magazine=diggit magazine}}</ref> Internet channels such as [[YouTube]] were used by candidates to share speeches and ads and to attack candidates by uploading videos of gaffes.<ref name="Pollard, Chesebro & Studinski 2009"/>

A study done by the [[Pew]] Internet & American Life Project in conjunction with Princeton Survey Research Associates in November 2010 shows that 54% of adults in the [[United States]] used the internet to get information about the [[2010 United States elections|2010 midterm elections]] and about specific candidates. This represents 73% of adult internet users. The study also showed that 22 percent of adult internet users used [[List of social networking websites|social network]] sites or [[Twitter]] to get information about and discuss the elections and 26 percent of all adults used cell phones to learn about or participate in campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=Pew Internet & American Life Project|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2011/The-Internet-and-Campaign-2010.aspx|work=The Internet and Campaign 2010|publisher=Pew Research Center}}</ref>

E-campaigning as it has come to be called, is subject to very little regulation. On March 26, 2006, the [[Federal Election Commission]] voted unanimously to "not regulate political communication on the Internet, including emails, blogs and the creating of Web sites"<ref name="Bimbaum">{{cite news|last=Bimbaum|first=Jeffrey|title=Loophole a Spigot for E-Mail; Critics Fear Voters Will Be Deluged as Fall Elections Near|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=June 11, 2006}}</ref> This decision made only paid political ads placed on websites subject to campaign finance limitations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trent & Friedenberg|title=Political Campaign Communication Principles & Practices|year=2008|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, MD}}</ref> A comment was made about this decision by Roger Alan Stone of Advocacy Inc. which explains this loophole in the context of a political campaign: "A wealthy individual could purchase all of the [[Email|e-mail]] addresses for registered [[Voting|voters]] in a [[congressional district]]{{nbsp}}... produce an Internet video ad, and [[e-mail]] it along with a link to the campaign contribution page{{nbsp}}... Not only would this activity not count against any contribution limits or independent expenditure requirements; it would never even need to be reported."<ref name="Bimbaum"/>

A key part of the [[United States]] presidential campaigns is the use of media and framing. Candidates are able to frame their opponents and current issues in ways to affect the way voters will see events and the other presidential candidates.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/upshot/big-picture-with-trump-vs-clinton-is-all-in-the-framing.html|title=Big Picture for Trump vs. Clinton? It’s All in the Framing|last=Vavreck|first=Lynn|date=2016-05-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-11-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> An example of this can be seen during the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]] with candidates [[Donald Trump]] and [[Hillary Clinton]]. Trump was able to successfully affect the way voters thought about Clinton, yet, Clinton was less successful in doing so in return. Trump primed voters to think of Clinton as ‘Crooked Hillary,’ or a ‘Nasty Woman,’ etc. The tactic of priming refers to the way that viewers’ opinions can be influenced.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12184766/media-boost-donald-trump-coverage|title=Yes, blame the media for Donald Trump. Up to a point.|last=Dickinson|first=Matthew|date=2016-07-14|website=Vox|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Trump was able to play into the interests of his voters, and while Clinton did so as well, her concentration of advertisements about defeating Trump was not always beneficial to her campaign. The media, and Trump, tended to focus on her [[Hillary Clinton email controversy|email scandal]], and when voters thought about her that is what came to mind. Trump played into voter's anti-government interests while Clinton appealed to the future of the country for the better of future children.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499321154/clinton-and-trump-the-final-sprint|title=How Trump And Clinton Are Framing Their Closing Arguments|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> Trump was incredibly successful at connecting to the interests of a huge portion of Americans. It was not always Clinton's strong point, but that may not have been her fault. Americans vote based on whether they feel the country is in a time of gains or a time of loss.<ref name=":0" /> Trump's campaigning and well-known slogan, “[[Make America Great Again]]” made Americans feel like the country was in a time of loss. When that happens, the electorate will be willing to take a risk on voting for the candidate with experience as long as he or she is convincing enough.<ref name=":0" /> Trump was convincing with his anti-everything rhetoric, and his message reached the electorate with the help of the media. Over half of the media coverage on Trump was focused on where he stood in the race, only 12% focused on issues stances and political beliefs (including problematic comments).<ref name=":1" />
