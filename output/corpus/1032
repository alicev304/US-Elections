List of governors of Georgia From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Georgia) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Not to be confused with the State Commissioners (informally referred to as "Governor"), the chief executives of the Regions of Georgia (country). Governor of Georgia Great Seal of the State of Georgia Incumbent Brian Kemp since January 14, 2019 Residence Georgia Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, renewable once Inaugural holder Archibald Bulloch Formation July 12, 1775 Salary $139,339 (2013)[1] Website Official website The governor of Georgia is the head of the executive branch of Georgia's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. The governor also has a duty to enforce state laws, the power to either veto or approve bills passed by the Georgia Legislature, and the power to convene the legislature.[2] The current governor is Republican Brian Kemp, who assumed office on January 14, 2019. There have officially been 77 governors of the state of Georgia, including 11 who served more than one distinct term. The early days were chaotic, with several gaps and schisms in the state's power structure, as the state capital of Savannah was captured during the American Revolutionary War.[3] After independence was achieved, the office was solidly Democratic-Republican until the 1830s, when the office began to be contested by Democrats and Whigs for a few decades. The state seceded and was part of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, after which it had several governors appointed by the President of the United States and the military occupation. During Reconstruction, it had two Republican governors, but after local rule was re-established, Democrats would be the only party elected for the next 131 years. The longest-serving governors are George Busbee, Joe Frank Harris, Zell Miller, Sonny Perdue, and Nathan Deal, each of whom served two full four-year terms; Joseph E. Brown, governor during the Civil War, was elected four times, serving seven and a half years. The shortest term of the post-revolutionary period is that of Matthew Talbot, who served 13 days after succeeding his predecessor who died in office. One man, Eugene Talmadge, died before taking office in his second distinct term, leading to a dispute in which three people claimed the office.

Georgia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and ratified the Constitution of the United States on January 2, 1788.[4] It seceded from the Union on January 19, 1861,[5] and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861.[6] Following the end of the American Civil War, Georgia during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District, which exerted control over governor appointments and elections.[7] Georgia was readmitted to the Union on July 25, 1868,[8], expelled from Congress for failures in Reconstruction on March 3, 1869,[9] and again readmitted on July 15, 1870.[10] In Georgia's Rules and Regulations of 1776, considered by some to be the first constitution, the chief executive was a president chosen by the legislature every six months.[11] This was quickly superseded by the 1777 constitution, which called for a governor to be chosen by the legislature each year,[12] with a term limited to one year out of every three.[13] The governor's term was lengthened to two years in the 1789 constitution,[14] and an 1824 amendment provided for popular election of the governor.[15] While the 1861 secessionist constitution kept the office the same, the 1865 constitution, following Georgia's surrender, limited governors to two consecutive terms of two years each, allowing them to serve again after a gap of four years.[16] The Reconstruction constitution of 1868 increased the governor's term to four years.[17] The 1877 constitution, after the end of Reconstruction, returned the office to the provisions of the 1865 constitution.[18] An amendment in 1941 lengthened terms to four years, but governors could no longer succeed themselves, having to wait four years to serve again.[19] The constitution does not specify when terms start, only that the governor is installed at the next session of the General Assembly.[20] The current constitution of 1983 allows governors to succeed themselves once before having to wait four years to serve again.[21] Originally, in the event of a vacancy, the president of the executive council acted as governor.[22] This was changed in 1798 to the president of the senate.[23] The 1945 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who would act as governor if that office became vacant;[24] in 1983, this was changed so that the lieutenant governor now becomes governor in the event of a vacancy.[25] The revolutionary government was thrown into disarray by the capture of Savannah in 1778, which led to several governments with varying levels of influence; they would reunite in 1780. The Official and Statistical Register of Georgia ignores the Council of Safety of William Ewen in favor of Archibald Bulloch's government, and omits the government of William Glascock and Seth John Cuthbert. The Register includes colonial governors in its numbering, listing Archibald Bulloch as the 7th governor.[26] Governors of the State of Georgia[a] No.[b] Governor Term in office Party Election Lt.

It continues the numbering from the colonial governors and omits repeat governors, thus marking Archibald Bulloch as 7th and George Busbee as 77th.[26] ^ The office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1945, first being filled in 1947. ^ The revolutionary government did not necessarily follow any schedule or term lengths, and thus the election year is omitted until 1781, when it becomes easier to determine. ^ Gwinnett was elected by the council to succeed Bulloch.[27] ^ The date given is the capture of Savannah, where the New Georgia Encyclopedia says his last official act as governor was to flee.[3] ^ a b c The capture of Savannah threw the government into disarray and exile, and records are scarce as to dates and leadership. William Glascock (elected January 21, 1779)[28] and Seth John Cuthbert (elected July 24, 1779), while often included in lists of governors, are omitted from the official state register, likely because of this reason. A school pamphlet from 1977 notes, "This confusing situation resulted in a number of radical Whigs, mainly from Wilkes County, organizing a second government with George Walton as governor and Glascock as speaker of the assembly. ... As a result of this makeshift election, there were two Whig governments plus the restored loyalist government."[29] ^ Howly resigned to be a delegate to the Continental Congress.[30] ^ a b George Wells succeeded Howly, but was killed in a duel on February 16, 1780; he is omitted from nearly every list of governors, including the official register. Stephen Heard then became governor.[31] ^ Some sources say Myrick Davies was elected in August 1780 and served until his death;[32] however, he is omitted from the official state register. ^ James Jackson was elected in 1788, but declined the position, citing inexperience.[33] ^ First term under the 1789 constitution, which lengthened terms to two years.[14] ^ Jackson resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[33] ^ Tattnall resigned due to declining health.[34] ^ Milledge resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[35] ^ Special election for the remainder of Josiah Tattnall's term[36] ^ Mitchell resigned to be agent to the Creek Indians.[37] ^ One source states Brown left office on June 25, which could make sense as it would take several days for news of Johnson's appointment to reach Georgia. However, this source has not been corroborated.[38] ^ Brown resigned following the defeat of the Confederate States of America.[39] ^ At least one source states Johnson left office "five days after" Jenkins took office, which would be December 19.[40] However, more contemporary sources say he left office on December 14.[41] ^ Johnson was appointed provisional governor by the Union occupation.[40] ^ Jenkins was removed from office by the military because he refused to allow state funds to be used for a racially integrated state constitutional convention; the state was still under military occupation during Reconstruction.[42] ^ Provisional governor appointed by General George Meade[43] ^ Some sources state Bullock took office on July 21, but more contemporary sources say July 4.[41] ^ Some sources state Bullock resigned on October 23, but that is when he secretly submitted his resignation; it did not take effect until October 30.[44] ^ Bullock resigned and fled the state to avoid impeachment; he was arrested in 1876 and found not guilty of embezzlement.[44] ^ First term under the 1868 constitution, which lengthened terms to four years.[17] ^ Special election for the remainder of Rufus Bullock's term[45] ^ First term under the 1877 constitution, which shortened terms to two years.[18] ^ McDaniel's first term was shortened, so it is not known if he can be considered term limited. ^ Special election for the remainder of Alexander Stephens' term[46] ^ The start of a gubernatorial term has always been set by the legislature, rather than the constitution; it appears the start of this term changed from the last Saturday in October to the last Saturday in June, lengthening it by eight months. ^ Sources are split on whether Smith resigned on November 15 or November 16, with contemporary sources leaning towards November 15.[47] ^ Smith resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[48] ^ Special election for the remainder of Hoke Smith's term[49] ^ The start of the term changed from the last Saturday in June to the second Tuesday in January, shortening this term by five months.[50] ^ First term under the 1941 amendment to the constitution, which lengthened terms to four years.[19] ^ Eugene Talmadge was elected to a third term in 1946, but died before taking office. Ellis Arnall, governor at the time, claimed the office, as did Lieutenant Governor Melvin Thompson. The state legislature chose Eugene Talmadge's son, Herman Talmadge, to be governor, but during what came to be called the "Three Governors controversy", the state supreme court declared this unconstitutional and declared Thompson rightful governor, and Talmadge stepped down after 67 days. Talmadge later defeated Thompson in a special election.[51] ^ Special election to fill Eugene Talmadge's term[51] ^ Represented the Democratic Party ^ Kemp's first term expires January 9, 2023.
