Sean Spicer stated that the administration believed there was a link between recreational marijuana use and opiate abuse, despite current studies that show the reverse and that marijuana use actually results in a lower incidence of opiate abuse.[7][8][4][5] Spicer said: "There is a big difference between the medical use […] that is very different from the recreational use, which is something the Department of Justice will be further looking into."[9] "There’s two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana. I think medical marijuana, I’ve said before, that the president understands the pain and suffering that many people go through, who are facing especially terminal diseases, and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them. And that’s one that Congress, through a rider in 2014, put an appropriations bill saying that the Department of Justice wouldn’t be funded to go after those folks."[10] A signing statement on the 2017 federal budget was one of the first official statements on the administration's policies.[11] In it, according to Bloomberg News, the President "signaled he may ignore a congressional ban on interfering with state medical marijuana laws".[12] On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded three Obama-era memos that had adopted a policy of non-interference with states that have legalized recreational marijuana, including the 2013 Cole Memorandum.[13] On April 13, US Senator Cory Gardner (R - Colorado) stated that Trump reaffirmed his commitment to upholding the rights of states to regulate cannabis within their associated jurisdictions and assured states with legalized cannabis that the rescission of the Cole Memo would not subject them to federal prosecutors, after Gardner threatened to block the appointment of 20 DOJ nominees in response to the memo's rescission.[14] In June 2018, President Trump stated that he would "probably" support the STATES Act, a bipartisan bill which would effectively end the federal prohibition on marijuana and leave the issue up to the states.[15][16] Response of the states[edit] Legality of cannabis in the United States Legal Legal for medical use Legal for medical use, limited THC content Prohibited for any use D Decriminalized Notes: · Includes laws which have not yet gone into effect. · Cannabis remains a Schedule I drug under federal law. · Some Indian reservations have legalization policies separate from the states they are located in. · Cannabis is illegal in all federal enclaves. v t e As of 2019[update], thirty-seven states have legalized marijuana for medical use. Alaska, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont, Michigan, and Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized it for recreational use as well.[17] On April 19, 2017, the governors of Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington sent a letter to the U.S. administration urging continuation of Federal policy under the Cole Memorandum.[18] Washington state[edit] Main article: Cannabis in Washington (state) In response to the February 2017 announced crackdown, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson stated Washington will defend its marijuana laws: “I will resist any efforts by the Trump administration to undermine the will of the voters in Washington state,” Ferguson said in an interview. On February 15, Ferguson and Governor Jay Inslee sent a letter to U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions stating that illegal dealing in the State of Washington has been replaced with a tax-paying regulated industry, and the move has freed up law enforcement officers for other duties. “Given the limited resources available for marijuana law enforcement, a return to ‘full’ prohibition’ is highly unlikely to end the illicit production, trafficking and consumption of marijuana,” said Ferguson and Inslee in the letter.[19][20] Nevada[edit] Main article: Cannabis in Nevada Responding to the February 2017 announced crackdown, Nevada Senate Majority Leader Aaron D. Ford called on the state’s attorney general to “vigorously defend” the state's laws. “Not only did voters overwhelmingly vote to approve the legalization of recreational marijuana, the governor’s proposed education budget depends on tax revenue from recreational marijuana sales,” Ford said. “Any action by the Trump administration would be an insult to Nevada voters and would pick the pockets of Nevada’s students.”[20][21] Oregon[edit] Main article: Cannabis in Oregon On February 24, 2017 Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon responded to the intended crackdown, stating, “The federal government needs to respect the decisions of Oregon voters. Instead the Trump administration is threatening states' rights, including the rights of one in five Americans who live in a state where marijuana is legal.” He stated he would ask the state to oppose federal government intrusion into the state.[22] References[edit] ^ "Pot Matters: Trump on Marijuana – High Times". ^ "7 Reasons Trump Is Unlikely to Fight Legal Marijuana". ^ Johnson, Jenna (October 29, 2015).
