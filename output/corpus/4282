Clinton won the South Carolina Democratic primary by a landslide margin of more than 47%, receiving a larger percentage of the African American vote than Obama, the first black President, did in 2008.[1] With the Republican Party having already held its South Carolina primary a week earlier on February 20, the Democratic primary in South Carolina was the only presidential primary on that day. Contents 1 Debates and forums 1.1 November 2015 forum in Rock Hill 1.2 January 2016 debate in Charleston, South Carolina 2 Opinion polling 3 Results 3.1 Results by county 4 Analysis 5 References Debates and forums[edit] November 2015 forum in Rock Hill[edit] See also: Democratic Party presidential debates, 2016 Rachel Maddow was selected to moderate the First in the South Candidates Forum with Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley, which was held at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina, on November 6, co-sponsored by the Democratic Parties of 13 southern states.[2] The forum was not in debate format; instead, each candidate was interviewed individually and sequentially.[3] Lincoln Chafee and Jim Webb were also invited, but their campaigns never responded to the invitations,[4] and both have since withdrawn from the race. A Public Policy Poll of South Carolina Democratic voters conducted from November 7–8, after the forum, discovered that 67% of viewers thought Clinton won the forum, 16% thought Sanders won, and 6% thought O'Malley won, with 11% unsure.[5] January 2016 debate in Charleston, South Carolina[edit] Main article: Fourth Democratic Party presidential debate, January 2016 in Charleston, South Carolina On January 17, 2016, the Democratic Party held a fourth debate at the Gaillard Center in Charleston, South Carolina. Hosted by Lester Holt and Andrea Mitchell, the debate aired on NBC News and was streamed on YouTube. It was also sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus. It was notable as being the final debate before the start of precinct caucuses and primary voting. Participants were Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O'Malley. It was the final debate appearance of O'Malley, who suspended his campaign on February 1. Both before and after the debate, commentators said the debate was focused on Sanders and his voting record on gun control and slights against President Obama, among other issues. During the debate, O'Malley interrupted to take 30 seconds to talk about "homeland security and preparedness".[6] Also during the debate, Clinton and Sanders had some back-and-forth exchanges to define themselves on Wall Street, foreign policy, and gun control.[6] Opinion polling[edit] See also: Statewide opinion polling for the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016 Delegate count: 53 Pledged, 6 Unpledged Winner Hillary Clinton Primary date 27 February 2016 Poll source Date 1st 2nd 3rd Other Official Primary Results February 27, 2016 Hillary Clinton 73.4% Bernie Sanders 26.0% Others 0.6% Clemson[7] Margin of error: 3.0% Sample size: 650 February 20–25, 2016 Hillary Clinton 64% Bernie Sanders 14% Others / Undecided 22% Emerson College[8] Margin of error: 6.0% Sample size: 266 February 22–24, 2016 Hillary Clinton 60% Bernie Sanders 37% Others / Undecided 3% NBC/WSJ/Marist[9] Margin of error: 4.8% Sample size: 425 February 15–17, 2016 Hillary Clinton 60% Bernie Sanders 32% Other 8% Bloomberg Politics[10] Margin of error: 4.9% Sample size: 403 February 13–17, 2016 Hillary Clinton 53% Bernie Sanders 31% Not sure 16% ARG[11] Margin of error: 5% Sample size: 400 February 14–16, 2016 Hillary Clinton 61% Bernie Sanders 31% Someone else 1% No opinion 7% Public Policy Polling[12] Margin of error: ± 4% Sample size: 525 February 14–15, 2016 Hillary Clinton 55% Bernie Sanders 34% Undecided 12% CNN/ORC[13] Margin of error: 6% Sample size: 289 February 10–15, 2016 Hillary Clinton 56% Bernie Sanders 38% Someone else 3% No opinion 4% ARG[14] Margin of error: ± 5.0% Sample size: 400 February 12–13, 2016 Hillary Clinton 65% Bernie Sanders 27% Other 1%, Undecided 7% YouGov/CBS News[15] Margin of error: ± 8.7% Sample size: 404 February 10–12, 2016 Hillary Clinton 59% Bernie Sanders 40% No Preference 1% NBC/WSJ/Marist[16] Margin of error: ± 4.6% Sample size: 446 January 17–23, 2016 Hillary Clinton 64% Bernie Sanders 27% Martin O'Malley 2% Undecided 7% YouGov/CBS News[17] Margin of error: ± 9.4% Sample size: 388 January 17–21, 2016 Hillary Clinton 60% Bernie Sanders 38% Martin O'Malley 0% Undecided 2% SC New Democrats Margin of error: ± ?% Sample size: 583 January 12–15, 2016 Hillary Clinton 47% Bernie Sanders 28% Martin O'Malley 2% Undecided 22% Polls in 2015 Poll source Date 1st 2nd 3rd Other YouGov/CBS News[18] Margin of error: ± 5.0% Sample size: 420 December 13–17, 2015 Hillary Clinton 67% Bernie Sanders 31% Martin O'Malley 2% No Preference 0% Fox News Margin of error: ± 5.0% Sample size: 364 December 5–8, 2015 Hillary Clinton 65% Bernie Sanders 21% Martin O'Malley 3% Other 1%, None of the Above 7%, DK 3% YouGov/CBS News[19] Margin of error: ± 6.0% Sample size: 420 November 15–19, 2015 Hillary Clinton 72% Bernie Sanders 25% Martin O'Malley 2% Undecided 1% Public Policy Polling[20] Margin of error: ± 4.9% Sample size: 400 November 7–8, 2015 Hillary Clinton 72% Bernie Sanders 18% Martin O'Malley 5% Unsure 5% Monmouth University[21] Margin of error: ± 4.9% Sample size: 400 November 5–8, 2015 Hillary Clinton 69% Bernie Sanders 21% Martin O'Malley 1% Other 1% No Preference 8% Winthrop University[22] Margin of error: ± 3.4% Sample size: 832 October 24 – November 1, 2015 Hillary Clinton 71% Bernie Sanders 15% Martin O'Malley 2% Refused 2% Undecided 9% Wouldn't Vote 1% YouGov/CBS News[23] Margin of error: ± 8.2% Sample size: 427 October 15–22, 2015 Hillary Clinton 68% Bernie Sanders 25% Martin O'Malley 1% Jim Webb 1%, Lincoln Chafee 0%, Lawrence Lessig 0%, No preference 4% Clemson Palmetto[24] Margin of error: 4.0% Sample size: 600 October 13–23, 2015 Hillary Clinton 43% Bernie Sanders 6% Martin O'Malley 1% Undecided 50% CNN/ORC[25] Margin of error: 5.5% Sample size: 301 October 3–10, 2015 Hillary Clinton 49% Joe Biden 24% Bernie Sanders 18% Martin O'Malley 3%, Someone else 1%, None/No one 1%, No opinion 4% Gravis Marketing[26] Margin of error: ± ?% Sample size: ?

Clinton won the primary in a 47-point routing thanks to ardent support from African American voters. According to exit polls, Clinton won the black vote 86-14, which comprised 61% of the Democratic electorate in the Palmetto State; she won among black women 89-11 who comprised 37% of the electorate. Clinton's near-unanimous support from black voters was fueled by their interest in a continuation of President Obama's policies,[32] and by black women who wanted to see a woman elected.[33] Clinton won every county statewide. She won in upcountry 66-34, Piedmont 74-25, Central South Carolina, including the region which is majority African American 78-22, Pee dee/Waccamaw 83-17, and lowcountry 70-30.[34] She also swept the major cities of Charleston, Columbia, Greenville, and Rock Hill.
