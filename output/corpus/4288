Sanders won in the cities of Portland and Bangor quite comfortably, but his particular strength was in rural areas outside of the cities where he ran up big margins. Sanders's landslide Maine victory limited Clinton's success in New England to a slim victory in Massachusetts and a more comfortable win in Connecticut on April 26.
