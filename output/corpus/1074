TFD[edit] The previous template that was located on this page, which was deleted per Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2009 November 8#Template:US elections, consisted of about a dozen navboxes as if it was like {{Navboxes}}, and was only being used in one article. The current template here is an entirely new and different one. Zzyzx11 (talk) 19:54, 9 October 2010 (UTC) Format[edit] My basic request for this table is that, at a minimum, it shows when the elections of each of three Classes of United States Senators will/were held. This will enable it to display one basic rotation of the Federal election cycle. Thanks. Zzyzx11 (talk) 04:44, 30 October 2010 (UTC) The template should probably update after each presidential election, or when the newest presidential election article is created.
