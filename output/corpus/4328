Sanders has also generally performed well in the Pacific Northwest. Having put Barack Obama over the top mathematically in its Democratic Primary in 2008, Montana again voted against Hillary Clinton in 2016. While Clinton won in the cities of Great Falls and Billings (where she had dispatched her husband earlier that month), Sanders won in Helena and Missoula and swept most of the rural counties of the state. However, that same day Clinton won large victories in California, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota and was able to claim the Democratic nomination.
