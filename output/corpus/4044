Under the Constitution, the president's clemency power extends only to federal criminal offenses.[1] Normally, all requests for executive clemency for federal offenses are directed to the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the U.S. Department of Justice for investigation and review. The pardon "is granted in recognition of the applicant's acceptance of responsibility for the crime" and "is not a sign of vindication and does not connote or establish innocence."[2] Contents 1 Definitions 2 Constitutional authority 3 Office of the Pardon Attorney 4 Pardons 5 Commutations 6 Responses 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Definitions[edit] "Executive clemency may take several forms, including pardon, commutation of sentence, remission of fine or restitution, and reprieve".[3] A pardon is an instrument of mercy that stops all proceedings and punishments in progress at the time pardon is granted; forgives prior acts within the penumbra of the pardon, if sentence has already been completed for pertinent offense; and prevents any future proceeding relevant to the pertinent offense. Although criminal conviction is usually antecedent to pardon, it is not necessary. (See, e.g., Ex parte Garland, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 333 (1866).) A commutation is the mitigation of the sentence of someone currently serving a sentence for a crime pursuant to a conviction, without vacating the conviction itself.[4] Constitutional authority[edit] See also: Powers of the President of the United States Article II of the United States Constitution gives the president the power of clemency. The two most commonly used clemency powers are those of pardon and commutation. A pardon is an official forgiveness for an acknowledged crime. Once a pardon is issued, all punishment for the crime is waived. The person accepting the pardon must, however, acknowledge that the crime did take place.[2] The president can only grant pardons for federal offences.[1] The president can also commute a sentence which, in effect, changes the punishment to time served. While the guilty party may be released from custody or not have to serve out a prison term, all other punishments still apply.[5] Most pardons are issued as oversight of the judicial branch, especially in cases where the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are considered too severe. This power can check the legislative and judicial branches by altering punishment for crimes. Presidents can issue blanket amnesty to forgive entire groups of people. For example, President Jimmy Carter granted amnesty to Vietnam draft dodgers who had fled to Canada. Presidents can also issue temporary suspensions of prosecution or punishment in the form of respites. This power is most commonly used to delay federal sentences of execution.[citation needed] The power of clemency is "one of the most unlimited powers bestowed on the president by the Constitution."[6] Office of the Pardon Attorney[edit] Main article: Office of the Pardon Attorney For 125 years, the key adviser to the president on clemency has been the Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney (PARDON) which normally reviews all requests for pardons.[6] Based on government data, lawyers, advocates for criminal justice advocates, and former officials from both the White House and the OPA, President Trump has bypassed the OPA, according to a 2020 investigation by The Washington Post. Unlike previous Presidents, President Trump has granted clemency to "well-connected offenders who had not filed petitions with the pardon office or did not meet its requirements."[6] On February 19, 2020, Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy requested information on the process used by President Trump's in deciding to grant clemency to 11 people on February 18.[7][8] In response to criticism that he has bypassed the DOJ's Office of Pardon Attorney, Trump said that he is the "chief law enforcement officer of the country."[9] Legal experts raised concerns that President Trump was "relying on his personal connections rather than the Justice Department’s established review process for finding convicts deserving of clemency."[9] Pardons[edit] President Donald Trump has issued 25 pardons as of February 18, 2020[update]: Date of Pardon Name Court Sentencing date Sentence Offense Notes August 25, 2017 Joe Arpaio United States District Court for the District of Arizona October 5, 2017 N/A – Arpaio's pardon was issued after his conviction, but prior to his being sentenced.
