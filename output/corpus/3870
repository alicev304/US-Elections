Stein, who had been the Green Party's presidential nominee in 2012 (receiving 469,627 votes)[5] would once again secure the Green Party nomination and lose in the general election, this time receiving 1.07% of the popular vote and no electoral college delegates.[6] She formally announced her second presidential bid during an appearance on Democracy Now! on June 22, 2015.[7] On June 15, 2016, she reached the necessary number of delegates for the presumptive Green nomination.[2] On August 1, 2016, Stein announced that she had selected international human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.[8] Stein officially received the Green Party presidential nomination on August 6, 2016, at the party's nominating convention in Houston, Texas.[3] Contents 1 Background 2 History 3 Fundraising 4 Platform and issues 5 Endorsements 6 Ballot status 7 Results 7.1 Recount petitions 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Background[edit] Stein speaking at a campaign event in Mesa, Arizona On February 6, 2015, Stein announced the formation of an exploratory committee for a campaign for the Green Party's presidential nomination in 2016.[9] In a June 2015 interview on The Alan Colmes Show, Stein said that she would announce her intention to run for President "certainly before the summer is up, probably a lot sooner than that".[10] In December 2015, Stein took part in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21) in Paris, speaking at several forums.[11][12] That same month, Stein took part in RT's tenth anniversary celebration conference in Moscow, speaking alongside international leaders.[13][14] On February 24, Stein was invited to speak at the Oxford Union at the University of Oxford in England.[15][16] In March 2016, Stein was one of only two presidential candidates to receive an A rating for their health plan from Physicians for a National Health Program, an advocacy group for single-payer health care, out of an analysis of the health plans of six presidential candidates, including the top two Democratic candidates and the top three Republican candidates.[17] In May 2016, the Marijuana Policy Project released a voter guide of the candidates of the four largest political parties (Democratic, Republican, Libertarian, and Green) in the 2016 election. Stein received an A+, tying her with Gary Johnson and placing her above the Democratic and Republican candidates.[18] History[edit] Stein began taking part in the 2016 Green Party presidential primaries in February 2016. Stein was immediately the front-runner and was described as "steamrolling to victory."[19] On June 15, 2016, the Stein campaign announced that it had received 203 delegates, enough to win the nomination on the first ballot at the 2016 Green National Convention.[20] During the 2016 Democratic National Convention the Green Party encouraged Bernie Sanders supporters to switch support.[21][22] Stein officially won the Green Party nomination on August 6, 2016.[3] Fundraising[edit] In an e-mail to supporters on June 10, 2015, Stein wrote "I'm preparing to make a big announcement next week." She also challenged her supporters to raise $10,000 in that time period. Two days later on June 12, Stein's campaign sent another e-mail indicating that she had surpassed that goal and raised her fundraising goal to $30,000. Stein noted that she would seek to qualify for matching funds from the federal government by raising at least $5,000 from residents of 20 states before receiving the nomination in 2016. The e-mail indicated that she had already raised more than the requisite amount from residents of California and that Washington State, New York, and others were very close behind.[23] In September, Stein's campaign said they had met the $5,000 mark in five states (California, Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and Washington) and had received at least half of that amount in eight others.[24] As of November 22, 2015, Stein's campaign had surpassed the requisite fundraising totals in at least 9 states. On November 28, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News reported that Stein would likely qualify for the initial public funding before January 1, 2016.[25] However, on January 3, Ballot Access News reported that Stein's campaign had only qualified in 13 states. It said that the campaign was trying to qualify in 8 others.[26] On January 8, Stein's campaign announced it had enough contributions to qualify for FEC funds.[27] Nevertheless, the campaign did not submit its request for matching funds and accompanying documentation until March 28, after which the FEC declared Stein eligible for matching funds on April 14, 2016.[28] In January 2017, Stein and her campaign received the final amount of matching funds from the FEC. The final check equaled $134,900. Overall, the campaign received $590,935.39 in matching funds.[29] Platform and issues[edit] Stein with supporters at a rally in Boston, Massachusetts This section relies too much on references to primary sources.

Results[edit] On Election Day, Stein finished in 4th with over 1,457,216 votes (more than the previous three Green tickets combined) and 1.07% of the popular vote. However, she finished three million votes under Gary Johnson as the Greens once again finished behind the Libertarian Party, though they did gain more votes than Independent candidate Evan McMullin and Constitution Party candidate Darrell Castle.[6] At the state level, Stein exceeded 2% vote share in Hawaii (12,737, or 2.97%), Oregon (50,002, or 2.50%) and Vermont (6,758, or 2.14%), while winning her most votes in California (278,657, or 1.96%). In 22 other states, she crossed 1% of the vote. At the county level, Stein won her highest percentage of the vote of any county in the United States in Humboldt County, California (4.36%)[33], and she achieved the third-place finish in Humboldt and Mendocino, San Francisco, Santa Cruz and Alameda counties in California, Multnomah County, Oregon (3.25%), San Juan County, Washington (4.33%), most counties in Hawaii (Kalawao, Maui, Hawaii and Kauai), and four out of all five boroughs of New York City (Kings, Queens, Bronx and New York counties), in addition to Prince George's County, Maryland and Menominee County, Wisconsin. In Kalawao County, Hawaii, Stein received 25% of the vote and came in 2nd place after Hillary Clinton, although only 20 total votes were cast in the county. Recount petitions[edit] Main article: 2016 United States presidential election recounts On November 23, Stein launched a public fundraiser to pay for recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, asserting that the election's outcome had been affected by hacking in those states.[34] Changing the outcome of these three states would make Clinton the winner, and this would require showing that less than 60,000 votes had been counted for Trump which should have been counted for Clinton. Stein filed for a recount in Wisconsin on November 25.[35] Stein subsequently filed for a recount in Pennsylvania on November 28,[36] and in Michigan on November 30.[37] After unfavorable rulings by the courts, Stein abandoned her recount bid in December 2016.[38] On December 18, 2017, the Washington Post reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee is looking at the presidential campaign of Green Party's Jill Stein for potential "collusion with the Russians."[39] See also[edit] Green Party presidential primaries, 2016 Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016 References[edit] ^ Pugmire, Tim (August 22, 2016).
