President before election James Madison Democratic-Republican Elected President James Monroe Democratic-Republican The 1816 United States presidential election was the eighth quadrennial presidential election. It was held from Friday, November 1 to Wednesday, December 4, 1816. In the first election following the end of the War of 1812, Democratic-Republican candidate James Monroe defeated Federalist Rufus King. The election was the last in which the Federalist Party fielded a presidential candidate. As President James Madison chose to retire after serving two terms, the Democratic-Republicans held a congressional nominating caucus in March 1816. With the support of Madison and former President Thomas Jefferson, Secretary of State Monroe defeated Secretary of War William H. Crawford to win his party's presidential nomination. Governor Daniel D. Tompkins of New York won the Democratic-Republican vice presidential nomination, continuing the party's tradition of balancing a presidential nominee from Virginia with a vice presidential nominee from either New York or New England. The Federalists did not formally nominate a ticket, but Senator King of New York emerged as the de facto Federalist candidate. The previous four years of American politics were dominated by the effects of the War of 1812. While the war had not ended in victory, the peace concluded in 1815 was satisfactory to the American people, and the Democratic-Republicans received the credit for its conclusion. The Federalists found themselves discredited by their opposition to the war, as well as the secessionist rhetoric from New England embodied by the Hartford Convention. Furthermore, President Madison had succeeded in realizing certain measures favored by the Federalists, including a national bank and protective tariffs. The Federalists had little to campaign on, and King himself held little hope of ending the Democratic-Republican winning streak in presidential elections. Monroe won the Electoral College by a wide margin, carrying 16 of the 19 states.

Tompkins of New York Declined to run[edit] House Speaker Henry Clay from Kentucky General Andrew Jackson from Tennessee James Monroe was the favorite candidate of both former President Jefferson and retiring President Madison. However, Monroe faced stiff competition from Secretary of War William H. Crawford of Georgia. Also, there was widespread sentiment, especially in New York, that it was time to end the Virginia dynasty of presidents, resulting in Daniel D. Tompkins and Simon Snyder, the governors of New York and Pennsylvania respectively, briefly considering running for the nomination. But Monroe's long record of service at home and abroad made him a fitting candidate to succeed Madison. Crawford never formally declared himself a candidate, because he believed that he had little chance against Monroe and feared such a contest might deny him a place in the new cabinet. Tompkins and Snyder realized they had even less chance of beating Monroe to the nomination, and instead positioned themselves to run for the vice-presidency. Still, Crawford's supporters posed a significant challenge to Monroe.[2] In March 1816, Democratic-Republican congressmen in caucus nominated Monroe for President and Tompkins for Vice President. Monroe defeated Crawford for the nomination by a vote of 65 to 54, while Tompkins defeated Snyder by a wider margin of 85 votes to 30.

With the end of the war and the nomination of Monroe, the Federalists abandoned their hopes of another fusion ticket, and the demoralized party failed to formally nominate a candidate. Senator Rufus King of New York, who had been the party's 1804 and 1808 vice presidential nominee, and who had been nominated for president by a dissident faction of the party in 1812, eventually emerged as the de facto Federalist candidate. Several Federalists would receive electoral votes for vice president, with former Senator John Eager Howard of Maryland receiving the most votes.[3] General election[edit] Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage of the winning candidate in each county. Shades of blue are for Monroe (Democratic-Republican), shades of yellow are for King (Federalist), and shades of green are for Independent Republicans (Democratic-Republican). Dispute about Indiana[edit] On February 12, 1817, the House and Senate met in joint session to count the electoral votes for President and Vice President. The count proceeded without incident until the roll came to the last state to be counted, Indiana. At that point, Representative John W. Taylor of New York objected to the counting of Indiana's votes. He argued that Congress had acknowledged the statehood of Indiana in a joint resolution on December 11, 1816, whereas the ballots of the Electoral College had been cast on December 4, 1816. He claimed that at the time of the balloting, there had been merely a Territory of Indiana, not a State of Indiana. Other representatives contradicted Taylor, asserting that the joint resolution merely recognized that Indiana had already joined the Union by forming a state constitution and government on June 29, 1816. These representatives pointed out that both the House and Senate had seated members from Indiana who had been elected prior to the joint resolution, which would have been unconstitutional had Indiana not been a state at the time of their election. Representative Samuel D. Ingham then moved that the question be postponed indefinitely. The House agreed almost unanimously, and the Senate was brought back in to count the electoral votes from Indiana. Results[edit] When the votes were counted, Monroe had won all but three of the nineteen states. King thought that a Monroe victory was inevitable, and did not seriously contest the election.[4] Each of the three states that were won by King voted for a different person for Vice President. Massachusetts electors voted for former United States Senator (and future Governor) John Eager Howard of Maryland. Delaware chose a different Marylander, sitting United States Senator Robert Goodloe Harper. Connecticut split its vote between James Ross of Pennsylvania and Chief Justice John Marshall. Maryland did not choose its electors as a slate; rather, it divided itself into electoral districts, with each district choosing one elector. Three of Maryland's eleven districts were won by Federalist electors. However, these electors did not vote for King or for a Federalist vice president, instead casting blank votes as a protest.

The actual Presidential candidates were rarely mentioned on tickets and voters were voting for particular electors who were pledged to a particular candidate. There was sometimes confusion as to who the particular elector was actually pledged to. Results are reported as the highest result for an elector for any given candidate. For example, if three Monroe electors received 100, 50, and 25 votes, Monroe would be recorded as having 100 votes. Confusion surrounding the way results are reported may lead to discrepancies between the sum of all state results and national results. The Federalist parties of New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Virginia did not provide a slate of electors, and as such Monroe was virtually unopposed in these states (though trivial Federalist electors received a handful of votes in New Jersey and Virginia).[6] [7][8] Tennessee cast votes but they have been lost to time.[9] James Monroe Democratic-Republican Rufus King Federalist Margin Not Cast Citation State Electoral Vote # % Electoral Vote # % Electoral Vote # % # Connecticut 9 - - - - - 9 - - - [10] Delaware 4 - - - - - 3 - - 1 [10] Georgia 8 - - 8 - - - - - - [10] Indiana 3 - - 3 - - - - - - [10] Kentucky 12 1,864 100% 12 0 0.00% - 1,864 100% - [11] Louisiana 3 - - 3 - - - - - - [10] Maryland 11 5,994 57.11% 8 4,502 42.89% - 1,492 14.22% 3 [12] Massachusetts 22 - - - - - 22 - - - [10] New Hampshire 8 15,225 53.30% 8 13,338 46.70% 1,887 6.60% - [13] New Jersey 8 5,441 98.02% 8 54 0.98% - 5,387 97.04% - [6] New York 29 - - 29 - - - - - - [10] North Carolina 15 9,549 98.37% 15 158 1.63% - 9,391 96.74% - [14] Ohio 8 3,326 84.87% 8 593 15.13% - 2,733 69.74% - [15] Pennsylvania 25 25,749 58.91% 25 17,597 40.26% - 8,152 18.65% - [16] Rhode Island 4 1,236 100% 4 0 0.00% - 1,236 100% - [7] South Carolina 11 - - 11 - - - - - - [10] Tennessee 8 ? ? 8 ? ? - - - - [17] Vermont 8 - - 8 - - - - - - [10] Virginia 25 6,859 99.94% 25 4 0.06% - 6,855 99.88% - [8] Electoral college selection[edit] Method of choosing electors State(s) Each Elector appointed by state legislature Connecticut Delaware Georgia Indiana Louisiana Massachusetts New York South Carolina Vermont Each Elector chosen by voters statewide New Hampshire New Jersey North Carolina Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island Virginia State is divided into electoral districts, with one Elector chosen per district by the voters of that district Kentucky Maryland Tennessee See also[edit] First inauguration of James Monroe History of the United States (1789-1849) 1816 and 1817 United States House of Representatives elections 1816 and 1817 United States Senate elections References[edit] ^ "National General Election VEP Turnout Rates, 1789-Present".
