Wright attended Gardner–Webb University and University of Alabama, graduating with a law degree and was later admitted to the legal bar in September 1916.[1][4][5] Military[edit] In April 1918, he enlisted into the United States army and was given the rank of private at Camp Shelby. He served as a member of the 149th Machine Gun Battalion inside the 38th Infantry Division.[1] He later served as the commander of the 105th Engineer Combat Battalion. During World War I he participated in the battles of Belleau Wood and Château-Thierry before being honorably discharged on August 31, 1919. After leaving the army he organized a unit of the Mississippi National Guard in Rolling Fork and was selected to serve as its first captain where he would lead the unit through the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.[4] Career[edit] During the 1920s Wright served two terms on the Rolling Fork Board of Alderman. In 1927, he was elected to represent the Twentieth district in the state senate and served until 1932.[6] In 1930, he was appointed to serve as the assistant director of the state tax commission to aid in the enforcement and administration of the tax laws.[7] In 1932, he was elected to the state House of Representatives and served until 1940. In 1932, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Committee on Highways and Highway Financing.[8] In 1936, he was appointed to serve as the chairman of the House Rules Committee and was also appointed onto the Levees committee and the Joint Committee on Executive Contingent Fund.[9][10] On March 19, 1936, he introduced a resolution proposing an state constitutional amendment that would allow for the election of highway commission members starting in the 1938 elections, but the resolution failed.[11][12] Speaker of the House[edit] In February 1936, Speaker Horace Stansel requested for Wright to be designated as the acting Speaker of the House and the request was accepted. On April 4, Stansel died from a heart attack while Wright was still serving as the acting Speaker and Wright participated in the planning of Stansel's funeral.[13][14] From June 23 to 27, 1936, Governor Hugh L. White was outside of Mississippi to attend the Democratic national convention causing Lieutenant Governor Jacob Buehler Snider to become the acting governor. When Snider left the state Senator John Culkin, President pro tempore, was elevated to acting governor. If Culkin had left the state the Speaker of the House would have became the acting governor, but Wright was not eligible as he was in an acting role. However, Culkin did not leave the state preventing a constitutional crisis over the succession of acting governor to not happen.[15] On September 14, 1936, he was nominated by Pearl Stansel and the House of Representatives voted by acclamation, as he faced no opposition despite statements made by John Armstrong and Ira L. Morgan about being interested in running, to formally appoint Wright as the Speaker of the House.[16][17][18][19] After being appointed to the speakership Wright appointed Hilton Waits to replace him as the chairman of the House Rules committee and appointed R. E. Lee to replace him as the chairman of the Highways and Highway Financing House committee.[20] Waits resigned shortly after being appointed as chairman of the House Rules Committee and Joe Owen was selected by Wright to replace him.[21] Wright would continue to serve as Speaker of the House until 1940.[22] On March 24, 1938, the House of Representatives voted twenty-one to nineteen in favor of drafting articles of impeachment against Land Commissioner R. D. Moore.[23] Wright appointed a five-man committee of Walter Sillers, John T. Armstrong, Gerald Chatham, Guy B. Mitchell, and Sam Lumpkin to draft the articles of impeachment.[24] Moore criticized the committee as being "stacked" against his favor by Wright.[25] Interlude[edit] Although it was speculated that he would run in the lieutenant gubernatorial election in 1939, he announced on July 19, 1938, that he would not seek another term in the House of Representatives and would not seek election to another office.[26][27] After leaving the House he started working for the law firm of John Brunini and Sons in Rolling Fork.[28] In 1942, he represented the Union Producing company at a House Ways and Means committee to argue for Mississippi to place flat taxes on oil producers rather than multiple severance and sales taxes.[29] After the Japanese attack on the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor the United States entered World War II and Wright attempted to rejoin the army, but was rejected due to his poor eyesight.[30][31] Lieutenant gubernatorial[edit] After being rejected from the army Wright made plans to reenter politics. On November 19, 1942, he met with friends in Jackson, Mississippi and stated that he would be a candidate in the lieutenant gubernatorial election.[30] In Janurary 1943, he formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the lieutenant gubernatorial election.[32] Walter D. Davis, a former member of the state House of Representatives and attorney in the Department of War, was appointed to serve as his campaign manager.[33] In the initial primary he won with a plurality of the vote ahead of Paul Spearman and Charles G. Hamilton, who were eliminated, and John Lumpkin, who would continue onto the runoff primary.[34] Wright defeated Lumpkin in the runoff with 155,265 to 108,661 votes winning the Democratic nomination.[35] In the general election he faced no opponents.[36] Gubernatorial[edit] In 1943, Wright was elected Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi. As Lieutenant Governor, he was presiding officer of the Mississippi Senate, one of only two 20th-century politicians to chair both houses of the legislature (Sam Lumpkin of Tupelo, Mississippi, being the other). Following the death in office of Governor Thomas Lowry Bailey on November 2, 1946, Wright filled the remainder of Bailey's term as 49th Governor of Mississippi. Wright's strong stand on hotly debated issues such as racial segregation and states' rights, which he favored, and civil rights, which he opposed, combined with the advantages of incumbency, won his election as the 50th Governor of Mississippi in 1947. Wright won the governorship in the first primary, defeating four opponents. Governor Wright's 1946–1952 administration concentrated largely on urbanization and industrialization, issues of increasing importance to rural states struggling to modernize their economies at the end of World War II. Fielding L. Wright governed Mississippi at a time when the state's economy, social customs, and race relations were undergoing slow but significant changes. 1948 presidential election[edit] During the 1948 presidential election he and former Governor Hugh L. White led the twenty-two member Mississippi delegation to the Democratic National Convention. On July 14, 1948, he led the Mississippi delegation in a walkout of the convention to protest the adoption of a pro-civil rights plank into the party's platform. On July 17, the Conferrence of States' Rights Democrats in Birmingham, Alabama suggested him as a candidate for the vice presidential nomination of the breakaway States' Rights Democratic Party and later accepted the nomination on August 11.[3] In the general election he and South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond won the popular and electoral votes of the states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and South Carolina, and received one faithless electoral vote from Tennessee. Death and legacy[edit] On May 4, 1956, Wright suffered a heart attack and died forty minutes later at his home in Jackson, Mississippi.[37] Following his death, his son Fielding Wright Jr. was selected to succeed him as the president of the United Cerebral Palsy of Mississippi, Incorporated.[38] His funeral was held on May 6, and was attended by Senator Strom Thurmond, state senator R. M. Kennedy, Mississippi Governor James P. Coleman, Mississippi Lieutenant Governor Carroll Gartin, and Mississippi Secretary of State Heber Ladner.[37] Thurmond stated that his death was "a tremendous loss to the South and to the nation."[1] On November 17, 1960, a section of Highway 61 inside Mississippi was designated as the Fielding L. Wright Memorial Highway.[39] Electoral history[edit] Fielding L.
