Republican National Committee From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Top institution of the U.S. Republican Party Republican National Committee Founded 1856; 164 years ago Headquarters 310 First Street SE, Washington, D.C. , U.S. Key people Ronna McDaniel (Chairperson) Thomas Hicks Jr. (Co-Chairperson) Todd Ricketts (Finance Chairperson) Elizabeth Harrington (Spokesperson) Website www.gop.com The Republican National Committee (RNC) is a U.S. political committee that leads the Republican Party of the United States. It is responsible for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. It is also responsible for organizing and running the Republican National Convention. Similar committees exist in every U.S. state and most U.S. counties, although in some states party organization is structured by congressional district, allied campaign organizations being governed by a national committee. Ronna McDaniel is the current committee chairwoman.[1] The RNC's main counterpart is the Democratic National Committee.

It consisted of one member from each state and territory to serve for four years. Each national committee since then has followed the precedent of equal representation for each state or territory, regardless of population. From 1924 to 1952, there was a national committeeman and national committeewoman from each state and U.S. possession, and from Washington, D.C.. In 1952, committee membership was expanded to include the state party chairs of states that voted Republican in the preceding presidential election, have a Republican majority in their congressional delegation (U.S. representatives and senators), or have Republican governors. By 1968, membership reached 145. As of 2011, the RNC has 168 members.[2] The only person to have chaired the RNC and later become U.S. president is George H. W. Bush. A number of the chairs of the RNC have been state governors. In 2013, the RNC began an outreach campaign toward American youth and minority voters, after studies showed these groups generally perceived that the Republican Party did not care about their concerns.[3] Chairs of the Republican National Committee[edit] List of RNC Chairs Chair Term State[4] Edwin Morgan 1856–1864 New York Henry Raymond 1864–1866 New York Marcus Ward 1866–1868 New Jersey William Claflin 1868–1872 Massachusetts Edwin Morgan 1872–1876 New York Zachariah Chandler 1876–1879 Michigan Donald Cameron 1879–1880 Pennsylvania Marshall Jewell 1880–1883 Connecticut Dwight Sabin 1883–1884 Minnesota Benjamin Jones 1884–1888 New Jersey Matthew Quay 1888–1891 Pennsylvania James Clarkson 1891–1892 Iowa William Campbell[5][6][7] 1892 Illinois Thomas Carter 1892–1896 Montana Mark Hanna 1896–1904 Ohio Henry Payne (Acting) 1904 Wisconsin George Cortelyou 1904–1907 New York Harry New 1907–1908 Indiana Frank Hitchcock 1908–1909 Ohio John Hill (Acting: 1909–1911) 1909–1912 Maine Victor Rosewater 1912 Nebraska Charles Hilles 1912–1916 New York William Wilcox 1916–1918 New York Will Hays 1918–1921 Indiana John Adams 1921–1924 Iowa William Butler 1924–1928 Massachusetts Hubert Work 1928–1929 Colorado Claudius Huston 1929–1930 Tennessee Simeon Fess 1930–1932 Ohio Everett Sanders 1932–1934 Indiana Henry Fletcher 1934–1936 Pennsylvania John Hamilton 1936–1940 Kansas Joseph Martin 1940–1942 Massachusetts Harrison Spangler 1942–1944 Iowa Herbert Brownell 1944–1946 New York Carroll Reece 1946–1948 Tennessee Hugh Scott 1948–1949 Pennsylvania Guy Gabrielson 1949–1952 New Jersey Arthur Summerfield 1952–1953 Michigan Wes Roberts 1953 Kansas Leonard Hall 1953–1957 New York Meade Alcorn 1957–1959 Connecticut Thruston Morton 1959–1961 Kentucky William Miller 1961–1964 New York Dean Burch 1964–1965 Arizona Ray Bliss 1965–1969 Ohio Rogers Morton 1969–1971 Maryland Bob Dole 1971–1973 Kansas George H.

Gov. Michael Steele described the party as being at a crossroads and not knowing what to do. "I think I may have some keys to open the door, some juice to turn on the lights," he said.[12] Six people ran for the 2009 RNC Chairmanship: Steele, Ken Blackwell, Mike Duncan, Saul Anuzis, Katon Dawson and Chip Saltsman. After Saltsman's withdrawal, there were only five candidates during the hotly contested balloting January 30, 2009. After the third round of balloting that day, Steele held a small lead over incumbent Mike Duncan of Kentucky, with 51 votes to Duncan's 44. Shortly after the announcement of the standings, Duncan dropped out of contention without endorsing a candidate.[13] Ken Blackwell, the only other African-American candidate, dropped out after the fourth ballot and endorsed Steele, though Blackwell had been the most socially conservative of the candidates and Steele had been accused of not being "sufficiently conservative." Steele picked up Blackwell's votes.[14] After the fifth round, Steele held a ten-vote lead over Katon Dawson, with 79 votes, and Saul Anuzis dropped out.[15] After the sixth vote, he won the chairmanship of the RNC over Dawson by a vote of 91 to 77.[16] Mississippi Governor and former RNC chair Haley Barbour has suggested the party will focus its efforts on congressional and gubernatorial elections in the coming years rather than the next presidential election. "When I was chairman of the Republican National Committee the last time we lost the White House in 1992 we focused exclusively on 1993 and 1994. And at the end of that time, we had both houses of Congress with Republican majorities, and we'd gone from 17 Republican governors to 31. So anyone talking about 2012 today doesn't have their eye on the ball. What we ought to worry about is rebuilding our party over the next year and particularly in 2010," Barbour said at the November 2008 Republican Governors conference.[17] 2011 election[edit] Main article: 2011 Republican National Committee chairmanship election Chairman of the Republican National Committee Reince Priebus at the Western Republican Leadership Conference in October 2011 in Las Vegas Michael Steele ran for re-election at the 2011 RNC winter meeting.[18] Other candidates were Reince Priebus, Republican Party of Wisconsin Chairman, Ann Wagner, former Ambassador to Luxembourg, Saul Anuzis, former Republican Party Chairman of Michigan, and Maria Cino, former acting Secretary of Transportation under George W. Bush. Steele's critics increasingly called on him to step down as RNC Chair when his term ended in 2011. A debate for Chairman hosted by Americans for Tax Reform took place on January 3 at the National Press Club.[19][20] The election for Chairman took place January 14 at the RNC's winter meeting with Reince Priebus winning on the seventh ballot after Steele and Wagner withdrew.

The effort is designed to help the party and its candidates bridge the technology gap. Para Bellum, translated from Latin, means "prepare for war."[81] References[edit] ^ National leaders - GOP.com ^ Fox News.com ^ Joseph, Cameron; Easley, Jonathan (March 18, 2013).
