Licensing Public domainPublic domainfalsefalse This signature is believed to be ineligible for copyright and therefore in the public domain because it falls below the required level of originality for copyright protection both in the United States and in the source country (if different). In this case, the source country (e.g. the country of nationality of the signatory) is believed to be United States of America. Note that this tag cannot be used on all signatures, as not all signatures are copyright-free. See Commons:When to use the PD-signature tag for an explanation of when the tag may be used.
