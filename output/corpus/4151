Trump grew up in Jamaica Estates, an affluent neighborhood in Queens, New York City. During his time at the New York Military Academy, he lived on campus; he later rented row houses in college. In 1971, Trump moved to a studio on 75th Street in Manhattan.[1] Since the completion of Trump Tower in 1983, Trump has lived in a three-level penthouse on the top floors. He purchased the Seven Springs mansion in Bedford, New York, in 1995. Upon Trump's election to the US presidency, he moved into the White House in Washington, D.C., while First Lady Melania and their son initially stayed at Trump Tower in Manhattan until the end of the school year before moving to the White House as well.[2] From his birth in 1946 until 2019, Trump listed his primary state of residence as New York; in September 2019, Donald and Melania moved their primary residence to Mar-a-Lago in Florida.[3][4] Contents 1 Current residences 1.1 Mar-a-Lago 1.2 Seven Springs 1.3 Trump Parc 1.4 Trump Park Avenue 1.5 Trump Tower penthouse 1.6 White House 2 Former residences 2.1 Queens, New York City 2.2 School living 2.3 Manhattan penthouse 2.4 Greenwich mansion 2.5 Fifth Avenue apartment 2.6 Virginia residence 2.7 Beverly Hills 3 See also 4 References 5 Works cited Current residences[edit] Mar-a-Lago[edit] Mar-a-Lago Main article: Mar-a-Lago Since September 2019, Trump's resort and residence Mar-a-Lago has served as the primary residence for Donald and Melania Trump.[4][3] Seven Springs[edit] Trump owns a 39,000 square feet (3,600 m2) mansion on 213 acres (86 ha) in Bedford and New Castle, New York. The mansion has an indoor pool of white marble on its first floor and sixty rooms, including thirteen bedrooms and twelve baths.[1][5] The property has a glass and stone orangery for growing citrus, with a bowling alley in its basement. Also on the property is a formal garden pavilion, a fountain in the front lawn, a greenhouse and root cellar, stone water tower, and a Tudor Revival house and courtyard known by the name of "Nonesuch".[5] It was formerly the home of Eugene Meyer and his family, including Katharine Graham. In 1919, Meyer had artist and architect Charles A. Platt design the mansion of sandstone from the property. He spent $2 million constructing it. Trump purchased the property in 1995 for $7.5 million. Trump originally planned to build a golf course there, however he was opposed by the governments of the three municipalities the property lies within, and he wanted to prevent a new course competing with his existing course nearby in Briarcliff Manor. Trump's plans changed for Seven Springs to include building fifteen mansions, each to sell for about $25 million, and renovating the two existing houses.[5] In 2015, Trump placed most of the property under a conservation easement, apparently signaling the abandonment of any major development plans.[6] Trump Parc[edit] Donald Trump developed the 38-story Trump Parc condominium skyscraper at 106 Central Park South, and often privately owns multiple units within it, which he rents for up to $100,000 a month.[1] Trump Park Avenue[edit] Trump has several apartments at Trump Park Avenue, where his daughter Ivanka lives.[1] Trump Tower penthouse[edit] Trump, Shinzō Abe, and others at Trump's penthouse, 2016 Main article: Trump Tower Described as Louis XIV-style, Trump's penthouse at Trump Tower has three stories and is reportedly worth $100 million. The interior, designed by Angelo Donghia, has gold-trimmed furniture, marble floors, columns, tables, and walls, frescoed ceilings, bronze statues, and crystal chandeliers.[1] White House[edit] Main article: White House As the president, Donald Trump currently lives in Washington, D.C. with his wife Melania Trump, the first lady of the United States, and their son Barron Trump. They have been the current tenants of the White House since Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2017. Former residences[edit] Queens, New York City[edit] 85-15 Wareham Place Trump lived with his family in Jamaica Estates, an affluent suburban neighborhood in Queens. They lived at 85-15 Wareham Place until he was four. The house, a six-bedroom Tudor, was built in 1940 by his father Fred Trump. In 1950, the family moved into a 23-room mansion Fred Trump built on two adjoining lots on Midland Parkway, directly behind the backyard of the house on Wareham Place.[7][1][8] Trump's parents lived in the house for the rest of their lives.[9] School living[edit] New York Military Academy Beginning at age 13, Trump attended and resided at New York Military Academy, a private boarding school in Cornwall, New York.[10] He subsequently attended Fordham University for two years and transferred to the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, where he lived in rented off-campus row houses.[1] Manhattan penthouse[edit] Around the 1970s Trump lived in a penthouse apartment at the Phoenix, a luxury apartment building on 65th Street in the Upper East Side in Manhattan. The apartment had large panoramic windows; he decorated the interior in beige, brown, and chrome.[1] Greenwich mansion[edit] Trump purchased a 20,000-square-foot (1,900 m2) mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, in 1982 for $4 million. The house has eight bedrooms, eleven baths, a 4,000 square feet (370 m2) guest house, a putting green and tennis court, indoor and outdoor pools, and a sauna.[1] Fifth Avenue apartment[edit] Trump and his wife Ivana lived in an apartment on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, which was decorated with beige velvet sofas and goatskin tables.[1] According to family friend Nikki Haskell, Donald and Ivana lived in Olympic Tower prior to moving to 800 Fifth Avenue [11] Virginia residence[edit] Trump had a residence at Trump Vineyard Estates, a 45-room 23,000 square feet (2,100 m2) mansion.[1] Beverly Hills[edit] Trump owned a five-bedroom mansion on North Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California from 2007 to 2019. Trump had rarely used it, and had put on the market and rented it out at different times.[1] In June 2019, he quietly sold the property, off-market, for $13.5 million. He had originally purchased it for $7 million, and claimed the house was worth $6 million for tax purposes.[12] From 2008 to 2009, Trump owned a neighboring house, an 11-bedroom Greek Revival mansion built in 1981. Trump purchased it for $10.35 million, but sold it for $9.5 million. It was previously a residence of Gabonese president Omar Bongo, who died in office in 2009.[13] See also[edit] Biography portal List of residences of Presidents of the United States References[edit] ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l Flamer, Keith.
