A&E Television Networks, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “A+E Networks” or “we” or “us”) owns, operates and/or provides this and other U.S.-based digital properties, such as websites, mobile apps, games or smart TV apps (each, a “Site”) subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Use. You agree that both your access to and use of the Sites are governed by these Terms of Use (the “Terms”). These Terms are a legal contract between you and A+E Networks, and by accessing and/or using the Sites, including registering for an account, interacting with the Sites, or submitting feedback through the Sites, you agree to follow and be bound by the Terms and to abide by all rules, terms, conditions, restrictions and notices in the Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, do not access or use the Sites. Promotions, sweepstakes, giveaways, contests, or other interactions with the Sites (each, a “Promotion”) are governed by these Terms unless specifically superseded by Promotion-specific terms. THESE TERMS CONTAIN PROVISIONS CONCERNING BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER (SECTION 1), DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES (SECTION 13) AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY (SECTION 14). 1. Dispute Resolution You and A+E Networks agree to arbitrate all Disputes between you and A+E Networks, except for Disputes relating to the enforcement of A+E Networks’ intellectual property. “Dispute” includes, without limitation, any dispute, action or other controversy, whether based on past, present or future events, between you and A+E Networks arising out of or relating to the Sites or the Terms, whether in contract, tort, warranty, statute, regulation, or other legal or equitable basis. The Terms are solely governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regards to its principles of conflicts of law that would require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. Except for Disputes relating to the enforcement of A+E Networks’ intellectual property, you and A+E Networks agree that any Disputes between you and A+E Networks relating to the Sites, or the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the Terms or the formation of this contract, including the arbitrability of any Dispute and any claim that all or any part of the Terms are void or voidable, must be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any such Dispute, or in small claims court in New York, New York, U.S.A. or in your county of residence if your claims qualify to be heard there. In the event of a Dispute, you or A+E Networks must send to the other party a notice of Dispute, in writing, setting forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving notice, the facts of the Dispute and relief requested. You may initiate proceedings by sending A+E Networks a Notice of Legal Dispute, available on the AAA website at WWW.ADR.ORG, to the following address: A&E Television Networks, LLC Attn: Digital Media Counsel, Legal & Business Affairs-Legal/Arbitration Notice 235 E. 45th Street New York, NY 10017 We will send any notice of Dispute to you at the contact information we have for you. You and A+E Networks agree to try to attempt to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiation upon notice of a Dispute for a period of 60 days. If you and A+E Networks do not resolve the Dispute in such 60 day time period or in small claims court, then you or A+E Networks may commence arbitration. You and A+E Networks agree that a Dispute will be heard before a neutral single arbitrator, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN A COURT OF LAW BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. Information regarding these rules can be found on the AAA website at WWW.ADR.ORG. In addition, you and A+E Networks agree that the following rules shall apply to the arbitration proceedings: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The United Nations Conventions on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall have no applicability. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. Unless the arbitrator finds the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, A+E Networks will pay all other AAA and arbitrator’s fees and expenses. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, NO ARBITRATION OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL BE JOINED TO ANY OTHER ARBITRATION OR CLAIM, INCLUDING ANY ARBITRATION OR CLAIM INVOLVING ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OF THE SITES, AND NO CLASS ACTION ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS OR ANY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY SHALL BE PERMITTED. PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. In no event shall any claim, action or proceeding by you or A+E Networks related in any way to the Sites be instituted more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds these arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and State courts located in New York County, New York, and you agree to submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of litigating any applicable claim or action.
