Opening Up America Again | The White House
Skip to content White House Logo CDC: Center for Disease Control Share Opening Up America Again President Trump has unveiled Guidelines for Opening Up America Again, a three-phased approach based on the advice of public health experts. These steps will help state and local officials when reopening their economies, getting people back to work, and continuing to protect American lives. ENGLISH ESPAÃ‘OL Overview Criteria The data-driven conditions each region or state should satisfy before proceeding to a phased opening. Preparedness What States should do to meet the challenges ahead. Phase Guidelines Responsibilities of individuals and employers during all phases, and in each specific phase of the opening. Criteria Proposed State or Regional Gating Criteria Satisfy Before Proceeding to Phased Comeback SYMPTOMS Downward trajectory of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) reported within a 14-day period AND Downward trajectory of covid-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period CASES Downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period OR Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period (flat or increasing volume of tests) HOSPITALS Treat all patients without crisis care AND Robust testing program in place for at-risk healthcare workers, including emerging antibody testing State and local officials may need to tailor the application of these criteria to local circumstances (e.g., metropolitan areas that have suffered severe COVID outbreaks, rural and suburban areas where outbreaks have not occurred or have been mild). Additionally, where appropriate, Governors should work on a regional basis to satisfy these criteria and to progress through the phases outlined below. Core State Preparedness Responsibilities TESTING & CONTACT TRACING Ability to quickly set up safe and efficient screening and testing sites for symptomatic individuals and trace contacts of COVID+ results Ability to test Syndromic/ILI-indicated persons for COVID and trace contacts of COVID+ results Ensure sentinel surveillance sites are screening for asymptomatic cases and contacts for COVID+ results are traced (sites operate at locations that serve older individuals, lower-income Americans, racial minorities, and Native Americans) HEALTHCARE SYSTEM CAPACITY Ability to quickly and independently supply sufficient Personal Protective Equipment and critical medical equipment to handle dramatic surge in need Ability to surge ICU capacity PLANS Protect the health and safety of workers in critical industries Protect the health and safety of those living and working in high-risk facilities (e.g., senior care facilities) Protect employees and users of mass transit Advise citizens regarding protocols for social distancing and face coverings Monitor conditions and immediately take steps to limit and mitigate any rebounds or outbreaks by restarting a phase or returning to an earlier phase, depending on severity Proposed Phased Approach BASED ON UP-TO-DATE DATA AND READINESS MITIGATES RISK OF RESURGENCE PROTECTS THE MOST VULNERABLE IMPLEMENTABLE ON STATEWIDE OR COUNTY-BY-COUNTY BASIS AT GOVERNORS' DISCRETION Guidelines for All Phases Individuals Continue to adhere to State and local guidance as well as complementary CDC guidance, particularly with respect to face coverings. CONTINUE TO PRACTICE GOOD HYGIENE Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer, especially after touching frequently used items or surfaces. Avoid touching your face. Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow. Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible. Strongly consider using face coverings while in public, and particularly when using mass transit. PEOPLE WHO FEEL SICK SHOULD STAY HOME Do not go to work or school. Contact and follow the advice of your medical provider. Guidelines for All Phases Employers Develop and implement appropriate policies, in accordance with Federal, State, and local regulations and guidance, and informed by industry best practices, regarding: Social distancing and protective equipment Temperature checks Sanitation Use and disinfection of common and high-traffic areas Business travel Monitor workforce for indicative symptoms. Do not allow symptomatic people to physically return to work until cleared by a medical provider. Develop and implement policies and procedures for workforce contact tracing following employee COVID+ test. Phase One For States and Regions that satisfy the gating criteria INDIVIDUALS ALL VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS should continue to shelter in place. Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home. Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents. All individuals, WHEN IN PUBLIC (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others. Social settings of more than 10 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed. Avoid SOCIALIZING in groups of more than 10 people in circumstances that do not readily allow for appropriate physical distancing (e.g., receptions, trade shows) MINIMIZE NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel. EMPLOYERS Continue to ENCOURAGE TELEWORK, whenever possible and feasible with business operations. If possible, RETURN TO WORK IN PHASES. Close COMMON AREAS where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, or enforce strict social distancing protocols. Minimize NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL and adhere to CDC guidelines regarding isolation following travel. Strongly consider SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS for personnel who are members of a VULNERABLE POPULATION. SPECIFIC TYPES OF EMPLOYERS SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES (e.g., daycare, camp) that are currently closed should remain closed. VISITS TO SENIOR LIVING FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS should be prohibited. Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under strict physical distancing protocols. ELECTIVE SURGERIES can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines. GYMS can open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols. BARS should remain closed. Phase Two For States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a second time INDIVIDUALS ALL VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS should continue to shelter in place. Members of households with vulnerable residents should be aware that by returning to work or other environments where distancing is not practical, they could carry the virus back home. Precautions should be taken to isolate from vulnerable residents. All individuals, WHEN IN PUBLIC (e.g., parks, outdoor recreation areas, shopping areas), should maximize physical distance from others. Social settings of more than 50 people, where appropriate distancing may not be practical, should be avoided unless precautionary measures are observed. NON-ESSENTIAL TRAVEL can resume. EMPLOYERS Continue to ENCOURAGE TELEWORK, whenever possible and feasible with business operations. Close COMMON AREAS where personnel are likely to congregate and interact, or enforce moderate social distancing protocols. Strongly consider SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS for personnel who are members of a VULNERABLE POPULATION. SPECIFIC TYPES OF EMPLOYERS SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZED YOUTH ACTIVITIES (e.g., daycare, camp) can reopen. VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS should be prohibited. Those who do interact with residents and patients must adhere to strict protocols regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under moderate physical distancing protocols. ELECTIVE SURGERIES can resume, as clinically appropriate, on an outpatient and in-patient basis at facilities that adhere to CMS guidelines. GYMS can remain open if they adhere to strict physical distancing and sanitation protocols. BARS may operate with diminished standing-room occupancy, where applicable and appropriate. Phase Three For States and Regions with no evidence of a rebound and that satisfy the gating criteria a third time INDIVIDUALS VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS can resume public interactions, but should practice physical distancing, minimizing exposure to social settings where distancing may not be practical, unless precautionary measures are observed. LOW-RISK POPULATIONS should consider minimizing time spent in crowded environments. EMPLOYERS Resume UNRESTRICTED STAFFING of worksites. SPECIFIC TYPES OF EMPLOYERS VISITS TO SENIOR CARE FACILITIES AND HOSPITALS can resume. Those who interact with residents and patients must be diligent regarding hygiene. LARGE VENUES (e.g., sit-down dining, movie theaters, sporting venues, places of worship) can operate under limited physical distancing protocols. GYMS can remain open if they adhere to standard sanitation protocols. BARS may operate with increased standing room occupancy, where applicable. Appendix Appendix Vulnerable Individuals 1.
