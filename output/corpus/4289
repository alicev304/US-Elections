With its heavily African American population, Hillary Clinton solidly defeated Bernie Sanders in Louisiana. The electorate in Louisiana was expected to be about half African American, as it was about 48% African American in 2008. Clinton won overwhelmingly in the major cities of New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette, and Shreveport, all with significant minority populations. Clinton also did well in the areas north of New Orleans and east of Baton Rouge in the 1st Congressional District, which is among the most conservative in Louisiana and the South at large. She also performed well in rural counties in Central Louisiana and those along the Louisiana-Texas border that are majority white as she had likewise done eight years prior.
