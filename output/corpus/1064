List of governors of Mississippi From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Mississippi) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Mississippi Arms of the state of Mississippi Incumbent Tate Reeves since January 14, 2020 Style Governor (informal) The Honorable (formal) Status Head of State Head of Government Residence Mississippi Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, renewable once Inaugural holder David Holmes Formation Constitution of Mississippi Succession Every four years, unless reelected Deputy Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi Salary $122,160 (2013)[1] Website Official website The governor of Mississippi is the head of the executive branch of Mississippi's state government[2] and the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[2] The Governor has a duty to enforce state laws,[3] and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Mississippi Legislature,[4] to convene the legislature at any time,[5] and, except in cases of treason or impeachment, to grant pardons and reprieves.[6] To be elected governor, a person must be at least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of the United States for twenty years and a resident of Mississippi for at least five years at the time of inauguration.[7] The Constitution of Mississippi, ratified in 1890, calls for a four-year term for the governor. He or she may be reelected once (prior to a 1987 amendment to the state Constitution, governors were limited to one term).[2][8] The original Constitution of 1817 had only a two-year term for governor; this was expanded to four years in the 1868 Constitution.[9] Uniquely among the states, the Mississippi Constitution requires a gubernatorial candidate to win not just a majority of the popular vote but also a majority of state legislative districts in order to be elected - if no candidate gets both majorities, the state House chooses from the highest two popular vote-getters[6][10]. The lieutenant governor is elected at the same time as the governor and serves as president of the Mississippi Senate.[11] When the office of governor becomes vacant for any reason, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term.[12] The governor of Mississippi is also appoints the members of the Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees. Contents 1 History 2 Governors of the Territory of Mississippi (1798–1817) 3 Governors of the U.S. state of Mississippi (1817–present) 4 Succession 5 Other high offices held 6 Living former Governors of Mississippi 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References History[edit] Since Mississippi became a U.S. state, it has had 64 governors, including 55 Democrats and 6 Republicans. Democrats dominated after retaking control of the state legislature; they passed a Constitution in 1890 that disfranchised most African Americans, excluding them from the political system for nearly 70 years, and made it a one-party state. The state's longest-serving governor was John M. Stone, who served two terms over ten years (his second term was extended to six years by a transitional provision in the 1890 Constitution).[13] The shortest-serving governor was James Whitfield, who served 1 1⁄2 months from 1851 to 1852. The current governor is Republican Tate Reeves, who took office January 14, 2020. Governors of the Territory of Mississippi (1798–1817)[edit] Prior to the Compact of 1802, parts of what is now Mississippi were claimed by the state of Georgia; see List of Governors of Georgia for this period. Prior to 1813, the panhandle of Mississippi was part of the Mobile District of the Spanish territory of West Florida; see List of Colonial Governors of Florida.
