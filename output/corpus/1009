Number of Governors of Missouri by party affiliation[A] Party Governors Democratic 38 Republican 15 Democratic-Republican 3 Liberal Republican 1 Missouri was part of the Louisiana Purchase, which the United States purchased from France in 1803. In its first year it was part of Louisiana. In 1804 all of the territory above what is modern-day Louisiana was broken off and administered by a governor based in St. Louis, Missouri until statehood. Prior to the purchase both France and Spain administered the territory in a similar manner. France initially had a commandant in charge of Upper Louisiana. Spain around 1770 began having a lieutenant governor in St. Louis and governor in New Orleans, Louisiana ruling the whole territory. For a list of governors under Spanish and French rule see Louisiana Governor. For a list of lieutenant governors ruling Upper Louisiana under French and Spanish control see List of commandants of the Illinois Country. Since the state capitol moved to Jefferson City in 1826 the governor has lived on the same block in the Missouri Governor's Mansion a block east of the Missouri State Capitol (although the current mansion is the third one). The current governor is Mike Parson, a member of the Republican Party.

The act took effect October 1, 1804, upon which the District of Louisiana was placed under the governance of Indiana Territory, then governed by William Henry Harrison.[3] # Picture Governor Took office Left office Appointed by 1 William Henry Harrison October 1, 1804 July 4, 1805 Thomas Jefferson Governors of Louisiana Territory and Missouri Territory[edit] The citizens of the District of Louisiana, unhappy with the governance specified by the act of 1804, set about immediately to petition Congress for a return to a military-style government to which they were accustomed under Spanish rule. Congress responded by passing an act on March 3, 1805 which changed the name of the District of Louisiana to the Territory of Louisiana. Power was vested in a governor who was appointed by the president to a term of 3 years. During times of vacancy, the secretary would act as governor.[3] On June 4, 1812, the Territory of Louisiana was renamed to the Territory of Missouri to avoid confusion with the newly admitted state of Louisiana. Later, Arkansas Territory was separated from the Territory of Missouri on July 4, 1819.[3] # Picture Governor Took office Left office Appointed by 1 James Wilkinson July 4, 1805 March 3, 1807[B] Thomas Jefferson 2 Meriwether Lewis March 3, 1807 October 11, 1809[C][D] Thomas Jefferson 3 Benjamin Howard April 17, 1810 October 31, 1812[E] James Madison 4 William Clark July 1, 1813 September 18, 1820 James Madison James Monroe Governors of Missouri[edit] Parties Democratic-Republican (3) Democratic (38) Republican (15) Liberal Republican (1) # Governor Took office Left office Party Lt.

However, it was officially recognized as a Confederate state by the Confederate government and was represented in the Confederate Congress and by a star on the Confederate flag. There were two competing governments for the course of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation did not consider Missouri a seceding state, therefore it was not part of Reconstruction. The Missouri Provisional Government is considered the official one on this list. Missouri secession (Confederate)[edit] 1861–1862: Claiborne Jackson 1862–1865: Thomas Caute Reynolds Missouri Provisional Government (Union)[edit] 1861–64: Hamilton Rowan Gamble 1864–65: Willard Preble Hall Notes[edit] A. ^ Table only includes state governors. 52 people have served as governor, two twice; the table includes these non-consecutive terms as well. B. ^ Wilkinson was removed from office by President Thomas Jefferson due to heavy criticism regarding his actions as governor and suspected involvement in the Aaron Burr conspiracy.[4] C. a b c d e f Died in office. D. ^ Lewis committed suicide or was murdered in Tennessee while en route to Washington to answer complaints about his actions as governor.[5] E. ^ Howard resigned from office to accept a commission as brigadier general of the Eighth Military Department.[6] F. ^ Vacancies in the office of the lieutenant governor are only listed if they lasted for the entire term. For a complete list of vacancies, see List of Lieutenant Governors of Missouri. G. ^ The fractional terms of some governors are not to be understood absolutely literally; rather, they are meant to show single terms during which multiple governors served, due to resignations, deaths and the like. H. ^ As president of the state senate, Williams succeeded to the governorship and filled unexpired gubernatorial term of Bates until a special election could be held. The office of lieutenant governor had been vacant following the resignation of Reeves in July 1865. I. a b Elected in a special election. J. ^ Dunklin resigned from office to be Surveyor General of Missouri and Illinois. K. ^ Lieutenant governor Boggs succeeded to governorship and filled the unexpired gubernatorial term of Dunklin and was later elected governor in his own right. L. a b c d e Lieutenant governor succeeded to governorship, to fill unexpired gubernatorial term. M. ^ Polk resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[7] N. ^ Lieutenant governor succeeded to governorship and filled unexpired gubernatorial term until a special election could be held. O. ^ The Missouri state convention declared the executive department of the state had expatriated itself and their offices vacant.[8] Jackson had fled the capital and aligned himself with the Confederacy. P. ^ Gamble was elected the provisional governor of Missouri by the state convention.[8] Q. ^ Stark stayed on as governor beyond the scheduled January 13 departure because the election of Donnell was challenged by the Missouri House of Representative.[9][10] R. ^ The Missouri House of Representatives refused to certify the election of Donnell on his scheduled January 13 inauguration until being ordered to do so by the Missouri Supreme Court after the House challenged the election which Donnell won by 3,613 votes.[9][10] S. ^ Wilson assumed office at 1:10 AM after Carnahan's body had been formally identified. The date is muddied by online resources which give conflicting dates. The National Governors Association biography lists October 18 as the start date. However, a New York Times article entitled "Pilot Sought Better Weather Before Crash," implies that the swearing in occurred on October 18 or perhaps even on October 19. The article was published on October 19 and it says the official change occurred at 1:10 AM, immediately after Carnahan was identified.[11][12] Succession[edit] Main article: Gubernatorial lines of succession in the United States § Missouri Other high offices held[edit] This is a table of congressional, other governorships, and other federal offices held by governors.
