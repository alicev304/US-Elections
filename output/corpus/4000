Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup/1 From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia < Help:Introduction to referencing with Wiki Markup Jump to navigation Jump to search Verifiability Why references are important Inline citations How to add them RefToolbar Citations the easy way Reliable sources Which sources are good enough? Summary Review of what you've learned << Back to tutorials menu "Wikipedian protester" by Randall Munroe, xkcd. Wikipedians famously demand citations for facts! Shortcuts WP:INTREF WP:INTREF1 One of the key policies of Wikipedia is that all article content has to be verifiable. This means that a reliable source must be able to support the material. All quotations, any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, and contentious material (whether negative, positive, or neutral) about living persons must include an inline citation to a source that directly supports the material. This also means that Wikipedia is not the place for original work, archival findings that have not been published, or evidence from any source that has not been published. If you are adding new content, it is your responsibility to add source information along with it. Material provided without a source is more likely to be removed from an article. Sometimes such material will be tagged first with a [citation needed] template to give editors time to find and add sources before it is removed, but sometimes editors will simply remove it because they question its veracity. This tutorial will show you how to add inline citations to articles, and also briefly explain what Wikipedia considers to be a reliable source.
