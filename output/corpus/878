The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population as of 2019[update] is over 8.54 million.[6] The area's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World. Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status. Slave labor and the land acquired from displaced Native American tribes each played a significant role in the colony's early politics and plantation economy. Virginia was one of the 13 Colonies in the American Revolution. In the American Civil War, Virginia's Secession Convention resolved to join the Confederacy, and Virginia's First Wheeling Convention resolved to remain in the Union; that led to the creation of West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.[7] The Virginia General Assembly is the oldest continuous law-making body in the New World.[8] The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008.[9] It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.

Virginia has a total area of 42,774.2 square miles (110,784.7 km2), including 3,180.13 square miles (8,236.5 km2) of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area.[10] Virginia is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C. to the north and east; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina to the south; by Tennessee to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the north and west. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River.[11] The state's southern border is defined as 36°30' north latitude, though surveyor error in the 1700s led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes.[12] From 1802 to 1803, a commission appointed by Virginia and Tennessee surveyed and set their border as a line from the summit of White Top Mountain to the top of the Cumberland Mountains. Errors discovered in 1856 led Virginia to propose a new surveying commission in 1871, but in 1893 the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of the 1803 line in the case Virginia v. Tennessee.[13][14] One result of this is the division of the town of Bristol between the two states.[15] Geology and terrain The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the Susquehanna River and the James River.[16] Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay.[17][18] Deciduous and evergreen trees give the Blue Ridge Mountains their distinct color.[19] The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic era.[20] The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains around Charlottesville.[21] The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the commonwealth, the tallest being Mount Rogers at 5,729 feet (1,746 m).[22] The Ridge and Valley region is west of the mountains and includes the Great Appalachian Valley. The region is carbonate rock based and includes Massanutten Mountain.[23] The Cumberland Plateau and the Cumberland Mountains are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the Allegheny Plateau. In this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the Ohio River basin.[24] The Virginia Seismic Zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude, because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. The largest earthquake, at an estimated 5.9 magnitude, was in 1897 near Blacksburg.[25] A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral. The earthquake was reportedly felt as far away as Toronto, Atlanta and Florida.[26] 35 million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting Chesapeake Bay impact crater may explain what earthquakes and subsidence the region does experience.[27] Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near Mesozoic basins.[28] More than 64 million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia in 2018[update].[29] The commonwealth's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular Luray Caverns and Skyline Caverns.[30] Climate Main article: Climate of Virginia Virginia state-wide averages 1895–2019 Climate chart (explanation) J F M A M J J A S O N D 3.3 45 25 3 47 26 3.8 56 34 3.4 67 42 4 76 51 4.1 82 60 4.6 86 64 4.3 84 63 3.7 79 56 3.2 68 44 2.9 57 35 3.3 48 27 Average max. and min. temperatures in °F Precipitation totals in inches Source: U.S. Climate Divisional Dataset Metric conversion J F M A M J J A S O N D 84 7 −4 76 9 −3 97 14 1 86 19 6 102 24 11 104 28 15 117 30 18 109 29 17 94 26 14 81 20 7 74 14 1 84 9 −3 Average max. and min. temperatures in °C Precipitation totals in mm The climate of Virginia is humid subtropical and becomes increasingly warmer and more humid farther south and east.[31] Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 26 °F (−3 °C) in January to average highs of 86 °F (30 °C) in July. The Atlantic Ocean has a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the commonwealth. Influenced by the Gulf Stream, coastal weather is subject to hurricanes, most pronouncedly near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.[32] In spite of its position adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, even the coastal areas have a significant continental influence with quite large temperature differences between summer and winter, particularly given the commonwealth climate's subtropical classification, which is typical of states in the Upper South. Virginia has an annual average of 35–45 days of thunderstorm activity, particularly in the western part of the commonwealth,[33] and an average annual precipitation of 43.32 inches (110 cm).[34] Cold air masses arriving over the mountains in winter can lead to significant snowfalls, such as the Blizzard of 1996 and winter storms of 2009–2010. The interaction of these elements with the commonwealth's topography creates distinct microclimates in the Shenandoah Valley, the mountainous southwest, and the coastal plains.[35] Virginia averages seven tornadoes annually, most F2 or lower on the Fujita scale.[36] In recent years, the expansion of the southern suburbs of Washington, D.C. into Northern Virginia has introduced an urban heat island primarily caused by increased absorption of solar radiation in more densely populated areas.[37] In the American Lung Association's 2018 report, Arlington and Fairfax counties received failing grades for high ozone pollution.[38] Haze in the mountains is caused in part by coal power plants.[39] Virginia currently plans for thirty percent of the state's electricity to be renewable by 2030 and for all of it to be carbon-free by 2050.[40] Ecosystem See also: List of endangered species in Virginia Forests cover 65 percent of Virginia, primarily with deciduous, broadleaf trees in the western part of the commonwealth and evergreens and conifers in the central and eastern parts of Virginia.[41] Lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance, with hickory and oak in the Blue Ridge.[31] However, since the early 1990s, Gypsy moth infestations have eroded the dominance of oak forests.[42] In the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found.[31][43] White-tailed deer, also known as Virginia deer, graze at Big Meadows in Shenandoah National Park Virginia is home to more than one million white-tailed deer, whose population have rebounded from an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 during the Great Depression.[44] Native carnivorans include black bears, bobcats, coyotes, both gray and red foxes, raccoons, and skunks. Rodents include groundhogs, weasels, nutria, beavers, both gray squirrels and fox squirrels, chipmunks, and Allegheny woodrats, while bats include brown bats and the Virginia big-eared bat, the state mammal.[45] The Virginia opossum is also the only marsupial native to the United States and Canada,[46] and the native Appalachian cottontail was recognized as a separate species of rabbit in 1992.[47] Birds of prey include ospreys, bald eagles, barred owls, red-tailed hawks, turkey vultures, brown pelicans, and 31 pairs of peregrine falcons, which are the focus of a reintroduction program in Shenandoah National Park.[48] Other birds include wild turkeys, quail, seagulls, Carolina chickadees, pileated woodpeckers, red-bellied woodpeckers, and cardinals, the state bird. Walleye, brook trout, Roanoke bass, and blue catfish are among the 210 known species of freshwater fish.[49] The Chesapeake Bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, and rockfish.[50] Running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish,[31] and amphibians include the Cumberland Plateau salamander and Eastern hellbender.[45] Virginia has 30 National Park Service units, such as Great Falls Park and the Appalachian Trail, and one national park, Shenandoah National Park.[51] Shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic Skyline Drive. Almost forty percent of the park's area (79,579 acres or 322.04 km2) has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System.[52] Additionally, there are 34 Virginia state parks and 17 state forests, run by the Department of Conservation and Recreation and the Department of Forestry.[41][53] The Chesapeake Bay, while not a national park, is protected by both state and federal legislation, and the jointly run Chesapeake Bay Program which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge extends into North Carolina, as does the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which marks the beginning of the Outer Banks.[54] History Main article: History of Virginia The story of Pocahontas, an ancestress of many of the First Families of Virginia, was romanticized by later artists.[55] "Jamestown 2007" marked Virginia's quadricentennial year, celebrating 400 years since the establishment of the Jamestown Colony. The celebrations highlighted contributions from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia's history.[56][57] Warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the Civil War, to the Cold War and the War on Terrorism.[58] Fictionalized stories about the early colony, in particular the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, first became popular in the period after the Revolutionary War, and together with other myths surrounding George Washington's childhood and plantation elite in the antebellum period became touchstones of Virginian and American culture and helped shape the states historic politics and beliefs.[59][55][60] Colony Main article: Colony of Virginia The first people are estimated to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000 years ago.[61] By 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as Tsenacommacah. The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west, and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, to the north and south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network.[62] Powhatan controlled more than 30 smaller tribes and more than 150 settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.[63] Several European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits, explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century.[64] In 1583, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted Walter Raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of Spanish Florida.[65] In 1584, Raleigh sent an expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America.[66] The name "Virginia" may have been suggested then by Raleigh or Elizabeth, perhaps noting her status as the "Virgin Queen", and may also be related to a native phrase, "Wingandacoa", or name, "Wingina".[67] Initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from South Carolina to Maine, plus the island of Bermuda.[68] Later, subsequent royal charters modified the Colony's boundaries. The London Company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary Charter of 1606, which granted land rights to this area. The company financed the first permanent English settlement in the "New World", Jamestown. Named for King James I, it was founded in May 1607 by Christopher Newport.[69] In 1619, colonists took greater control with an elected legislature called the House of Burgesses. With the bankruptcy of the London Company in 1624, the settlement was taken into royal authority as an English crown colony.[70] Williamsburg was Virginia's capital from 1699 to 1780. Life in the colony was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, including the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes.[71] By 1624, only 3,400 of the 6,000 early settlers had survived.[72] However, European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants.[73] The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia.[74] African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift to a system of African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away,[75] and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655.[76] Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.[77] Tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as eighty percent of the population.[78] Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William & Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699.[79] In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains.[80] France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment, was led by then-Lieutenant Colonel George Washington.[81] Statehood 1851 painting of Patrick Henry's speech before the House of Burgesses on the Virginia Resolves against the Stamp Act of 1765 The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others.[82] Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year.[83] After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution.[84] Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.[85] When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was selected to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack.[86] In 1781, the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula, where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.[87] Virginians were instrumental in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789.[85] Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846.[88] Virginia is called the "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states such as Kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.[89] Civil War and aftermath Main article: Virginia in the American Civil War Richmond was made the capital of the Confederacy in 1861, and was partially burned by them prior its recapture by Union forces in 1865. In addition to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries.[90] The execution of Gabriel Prosser in 1800, Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831 and John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31 percent of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved.[91][92] This division contributed to the start of the American Civil War. Virginia voted to secede from the United States on April 17, 1861, after the Battle of Fort Sumter and Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers. On April 24, Virginia joined the Confederate States of America, which chose Richmond as its capital.[89] After the 1861 Wheeling Convention, 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of West Virginia, which chose to remain loyal to the Union. Virginian general Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia in 1862, and led invasions into Union territory, ultimately becoming commander of all Confederate forces. During the war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including Bull Run, the Seven Days Battles, Chancellorsville, and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House.[93] After the capture of Richmond in April 1865, the state capital was briefly moved to Lynchburg,[94] while the Confederate leadership fled to Danville.[95] Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the Committee of Nine.[96] During the post-war Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights.[97] The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883.[98] It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans.[99] Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.[100] Post-Reconstruction Many Pre-Dreadnought and World War I-era warships were built in Newport News, including the USS Virginia. New economic forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered around Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923.[101] During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port.[102] In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.[103] Though their project, like others in the state, had to contend with the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.[104] The Virginia Civil Rights Memorial was erected in 2008 to commemorate the protests which led to school desegregation. Protests started by Barbara Rose Johns in 1951 in Farmville against segregated schools led to the lawsuit Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. This case, filed by Richmond natives Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill, was decided in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education, which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal". But, in 1958, under the policy of "massive resistance" led by the influential segregationist Senator Harry F. Byrd and his Byrd Organization, the Commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding.[105] The civil rights movement gained many participants in the 1960s. It achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1964 the United States Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools.[106] In 1967, the Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with Loving v. Virginia. From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States.[107] The Cold War led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth.[108] The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was flown into the building.[109] Cities and towns Cities See also: Political subdivisions of Virginia and Virginia statistical areas v t e Largest cities or towns in Virginia Source:[110] Rank Name Pop.

Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships. Metropolitan areas Virginia has 11 Metropolitan Statistical Areas; Northern Virginia, Hampton Roads, and Richmond-Petersburg are the three most populous. 2.9 million people — 35% of Virginians — live in Northern Virginia (or "NoVa"), which is located immediately across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. and is part of the Washington metropolitan area with 6.2 million people.

Presbyterian, Pentecostal, Congregationalist, and Episcopalian adherents each comprised less than two percent of the population as of 2010[update].[155] The Episcopal Diocese of Virginia, Southern Virginia, and Southwestern Virginia support the various Episcopal churches. In November 2006, 15 conservative Episcopal churches voted to split from the Diocese of Virginia over the ordination of openly gay bishops and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger Anglican Communion through other bodies outside the United States. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided in favor of the mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.[158] Among other religions, adherents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints constitute one percent of the population, with two hundred congregations in Virginia as of 2017[update].[159] Fairfax Station is the site of the Ekoji Buddhist Temple, of the Jodo Shinshu school, and the Hindu Durga Temple.

The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the University of Virginia Health System, is highly ranked in endocrinology according to U.S. News & World Report.[274] Virginia has a ratio of 127 primary care physicians per 10,000 residents, which is the 16th highest nationally.[266] Virginia was one of five states to receive a perfect score in disaster preparedness according to a 2008 report by the Trust for America's Health, based on criteria such as detecting pathogens and distributing vaccines and medical supplies.[275] Transportation Main article: Transportation in Virginia Rosslyn station in Arlington is the busiest choke point of the Washington Metro subway system.[276] Because of the 1932 Byrd Road Act, the state government controls most of Virginia's roads, instead of a local county authority as is usual in other states.[277] As of 2018[update], the Virginia Department of Transportation owns and operates 57,867 miles (93,128 km) of the total 70,105 miles (112,823 km) of roads in the state, making it the third largest state highway system in the United States.[278] Although the Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes Northern Virginia, has the second highest rate of traffic congestion in the nation, Virginia as a whole has the 21st-lowest rate of congestion and the average commute time is 26.9 minutes.[279][280] Virginia hit peak car usage before the year 2000, making it one of the first such states.[281] The main terminal of Washington Dulles International Airport is one of the few surviving examples of Space Age architecture. Virginia has Amtrak passenger rail service along several corridors, and Virginia Railway Express (VRE) maintains two commuter lines into Washington, D.C. from Fredericksburg and Manassas. VRE is one of the nation's fastest growing commuter rail services, handling nearly 20,000 passengers a day.[282] Arlington accounted for forty percent of Virginia's public transit trips as of 2013[update], with most of that being from the Washington Metro transit system, which also serves Alexandria and communities in Fairfax County along I-66.[283] The system is currently expanding west into additional areas of Loudoun County.[284] Major freight railroads in Virginia include Norfolk Southern and CSX Transportation. Commuter buses include the Fairfax Connector, FRED buses in Fredericksburg, and OmniRide in Prince William County.[285] The Virginia Department of Transportation operates several free ferries throughout Virginia, the most notable being the Jamestown-Scotland ferry which crosses the James River in Surry County.[286] Virginia has five major airports: Washington Dulles International and Reagan Washington National in Northern Virginia, both of which handle more than twenty million passengers a year; Richmond International; and Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport and Norfolk International serving the Hampton Roads area. Several other airports offer limited commercial passenger service, and sixty-six public airports serve the state's aviation needs.[287] The Virginia Port Authority's main seaports are those in Hampton Roads, which carried 69,416,600 short tons (62,973,700 t) of total cargo in 2018[update], the fifth most of United States ports.[288] The Eastern Shore of Virginia is the site of Wallops Flight Facility, a rocket testing center owned by NASA, and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, a commercial spaceport.[289][290] Space tourism is also offered through Vienna-based Space Adventures.[291] Law and government Main article: Government of Virginia The Virginia State Capitol, designed by Thomas Jefferson and Charles-Louis Clérisseau, is home to the Virginia General Assembly. In colonial Virginia, free men elected the lower house of the legislature, called the House of Burgesses, which together with the Governor's Council, made the "General Assembly". Founded in 1619, the Virginia General Assembly is still in existence as the oldest legislature in the Western Hemisphere.[292] In 2008, the government was ranked by the Pew Center on the States with an A-minus in terms of its efficiency, effectiveness, and infrastructure, tied with Utah and Washington. This was the second consecutive time Virginia received the highest grade in the nation.[9] Since 1971, the government has functioned under the seventh Constitution of Virginia, which provides for a strong legislature and a unified judicial system. Similar to the federal structure, the government is divided in three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislature is the General Assembly, a bicameral body whose 100-member House of Delegates and 40-member Senate write the laws for the Commonwealth. The Assembly is stronger than the executive, as it selects judges and justices. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve four-year terms, with the most recent elections for both taking place in November 2019. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor are elected every four years in separate elections, with the next taking place in November 2021. Incumbent governors cannot run for re-election, however the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General can, and governors may serve non-consecutive terms.[293] The lieutenant governor is the official head of the Senate, and is responsible for breaking ties. The House selects a Speaker, as well as majority and minority leaders. The judicial system, also the oldest in America, consists of a hierarchy from the Supreme Court of Virginia and the Court of Appeals of Virginia to the Circuit Courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower General District Courts and Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts.[294] The Supreme Court has seven justices who are elected by a majority vote in both the House and Senate, and serve twelve-year terms, with a mandatory retirement age of 73. The Supreme Court selects its own Chief Justice, who is informally limited to two four-year terms.[295] The Code of Virginia is the statutory law, and consists of the codified legislation of the General Assembly. The Virginia State Police is the largest law enforcement agency in Virginia. The Virginia Capitol Police is the oldest police department in the United States.[296] The Virginia National Guard consists of 7,500 soldiers in the Virginia Army National Guard and 1,200 airmen in the Virginia Air National Guard.[297] Since the resumption of capital punishment in Virginia in 1982, 113 people have been executed, the second highest number in the nation, and three inmates are on the state's death row as of 2019[update].[298] Virginia has the fourth lowest violent crime rate and 13th-lowest property crime rate as of 2018[update] according to FBI data.[299] Since Virginia ended prisoner parole in 1995, the rate of recidivism has fallen to 23.4 percent in 2019, the lowest nationwide.[300] Politics Main article: Politics of Virginia See also: Elections in Virginia and Political party strength in Virginia The annual Shad Planking event in Sussex County is a traditional stop for state election candidates.[301] Over the 20th century, Virginia shifted from a largely rural, politically Southern and conservative state to a more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate environment. Up until the 1970s, Virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the Byrd Organization.[302] The legacy of slavery in the state effectively disfranchised African Americans until after passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s.[303] Enfranchisement and immigration of other groups, especially Hispanics, have placed growing importance on minority voting,[304] while voters who identify as "white working-class" declined by three percent between 2008 and 2012.[305] Regional differences also play a large part in Virginia politics.[306] While urban and growing suburban areas, including much of Northern Virginia, form the Democratic Party base, rural southern and western areas moved to support the Republican Party in response to its "southern strategy".[307][308] Rural Democratic support has nevertheless persisted in union-influenced Roanoke in Southwest Virginia, college towns such as Charlottesville and Blacksburg, and the southeastern Black Belt Region.[309] State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.[301] State elections State elections in Virginia occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following U.S. presidential elections and Senate elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections, as both have four-year terms. House of Delegates elections take place concurrent with each of those elections as members have two-year terms. National politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and Virginia has elected governors of the party opposite the U.S. president in ten of the last eleven contests, with only Terry McAuliffe beating the trend.[310][311] McAuliffe, a Democrat, was elected Governor in the 2013 elections by two percentage points during Barack Obama's second presidential term.[312] Republicans, however, held a super-majority (68–32) of seats in the House of Delegates, which they had first gained in the 2011 state elections.[313] Republicans also held a one-vote majority the state senate, which they then maintained in the 2015 election.[314] Eleven house district lines used in these elections, drawn following the 2010 U.S. Census, were later judged unconstitutional for discriminating against African Americans.[315] 2017 Gubernatorial election winner by county Northam: 40-49% 50-59% 60-69% 70-79% 80+% Gillespie: 40-49% 50-59% 60-69% 70-79% 80+% The 2017 statewide elections resulted in Democrats holding the three highest offices, with outgoing lieutenant governor Ralph Northam winning the governorship, Justin Fairfax elected lieutenant governor, and Mark Herring continuing as attorney general. In concurrent House of Delegates elections, Democrats flipped fifteen of the Republicans' previous sixteen-seat majority.[316] Control of the House came down to the tied election in the 94th district, which was won by Republicans through drawing of lots, giving the party a slim 51–49 majority in the 2018–19 legislative sessions.[317] Despite a political crisis that February, Democrats took full control of the General Assembly in the November 2019 elections,[318] the first after several districts were redrawn because of discrimination.[319] Federal elections See also: United States presidential elections in Virginia In federal elections since 2006, both parties have seen successes. Republican Senator George Allen lost close races in 2006, to Democratic newcomer Jim Webb, and again in 2012, to Webb's replacement, former Governor Tim Kaine.[320] In 2008, Democrats won both United States Senate seats; former Governor Mark Warner was elected to replace retiring Republican John Warner.[321] In the 2010 mid-term elections, the first under President Obama, Republicans flipped three United States House of Representatives seats from the Democrats, while in the 2018 mid-terms, the first under President Trump, Democrats flipped three seats from Republicans. Of the state's eleven seats in the House of Representatives, Democrats currently hold seven and Republicans hold four. Though Virginia was considered a "swing state" in recent presidential elections,[7] Democrat Barack Obama carried Virginia's 13 electoral votes in 2008 and 2012,[305] while Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the state in 2016. Virginia had previously voted for Republican presidential candidates in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004.[7] Virginia currently holds its presidential primary election on Super Tuesday, the same day as thirteen other states, with the most recent held on March 3, 2020.[322] Sports See also: Sports teams in Virginia The Virginia Cavaliers won the 2019 NCAA Championship and the overall men's program was twice awarded the Capital One Cup in 2015 and 2019 for leading the nation in overall athletics. Virginia is the most populous U.S. state without a major professional sports league franchise.[323] The reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state, the proximity of teams in Washington, D.C. and North Carolina, and a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums.[324][325] A proposed arena in Virginia Beach designed for an NBA franchise became the latest unsuccessful sports initiative when the city council there ended support in 2017.[326] Norfolk is however host to two minor league teams: The AAA Norfolk Tides and the ECHL's Norfolk Admirals. The San Francisco Giants' AA team, the Richmond Flying Squirrels, began play at The Diamond in 2010, replacing the AAA Richmond Braves, who relocated after 2008.[327] Additionally, the Washington Nationals, Boston Red Sox, Cleveland Indians, Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees, and Toronto Blue Jays also have Single-A and Rookie-level farm teams in Virginia.[328] The state is also home to a United Soccer League club, the Richmond Kickers.[329] The Washington Redskins have Redskins Park, their headquarters, in Ashburn and their training facility is in Richmond,[330] and the Washington Capitals train at Kettler Capitals Iceplex in Ballston. Virginia has many professional caliber golf courses including the Greg Norman course at Lansdowne Resort and Kingsmill Resort, home of the Kingsmill Championship, an LPGA Tour tournament. NASCAR currently schedules Monster Energy NASCAR Cup races on two tracks in Virginia: Martinsville Speedway and Richmond Raceway. Virginia natives currently competing in the series include Denny Hamlin and Elliott Sadler.[331] The Virginia Tech Hokies football team has the longest bowl game streak in the nation.[332] Virginia does not allow state appropriated funds to be used for either operational or capital expenses for intercollegiate athletics.[333] Despite this, both the Virginia Cavaliers and Virginia Tech Hokies have been able to field competitive teams in the Atlantic Coast Conference and maintain modern facilities. Their rivalry is followed statewide. Twelve other universities compete in NCAA Division I, particularly in the Atlantic 10 Conference, Big South Conference, and Colonial Athletic Association. Three historically black schools compete in the Division II Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and two others (Hampton and Norfolk State) compete in Division I. Several smaller schools compete in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference and the USA South Athletic Conference of NCAA Division III. The NCAA currently holds its Division III championships in football, men's basketball, volleyball and softball in Salem.[334] State symbols Main article: List of Virginia state symbols The state slogan, "Virginia is for Lovers", was developed in 1968 and is featured on the state's welcome signs. The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "Dominion" by King Charles II of England at the time of The Restoration, because it had remained loyal to the crown during the English Civil War, and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called Cavaliers, and "The Cavalier State" nickname was popularized after the American Civil War to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the University of Virginia are called the Cavaliers.[335] The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as President of the United States, including four of the first five.[1] The state's motto, Sic Semper Tyrannis, translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930.[1] The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century.[336] The Virginia reel is among the square dances classified as the state dance.[337] In March 2015, after 20 years without a state song, Virginia received two: "Our Great Virginia" (official traditional state song) and "Sweet Virginia Breeze" (official popular state song).[338] In 1940, Virginia made "Carry Me Back to Old Virginny" the state song, but it was retired in 1997 and reclassified as the state song emeritus.[339] Mammal: Virginia big-eared bat Beverages: Milk, Rye Whiskey Boat: Chesapeake Bay deadrise Bird: Cardinal Dance: Square dancing Dog: American Foxhound Fish: Brook trout, striped bass Flower/Tree: Dogwood Fossil: Chesapecten jeffersonius Insect: Tiger swallowtail Motto: Sic Semper Tyrannis Nickname: The Old Dominion Shell: Eastern oyster Slogan: Virginia is for Lovers Songs: "Our Great Virginia", "Sweet Virginia Breeze" Tartan: Virginia Quadricentennial See also Virginia portal United States portal Index of Virginia-related articles Outline of Virginia References ^ a b c d "Factpack" (PDF).
