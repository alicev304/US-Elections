The longest term was that of the first governor, Thomas Mifflin, who served three full terms as governor in addition to two years as president. The shortest term belonged to John Bell, who served only 19 days as acting governor after his predecessor, Edward Martin resigned. The current governor is Democrat Tom Wolf, whose term began on January 20, 2015.

Prior to declaring its independence, Pennsylvania was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain; see the list of colonial governors for the pre-statehood period. Presidents of the Supreme Executive Council[edit] The first Pennsylvania constitution in 1776 created the Supreme Executive Council as the state's executive branch, with the President of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as its head.[7] The president was chosen annually by the council, though with no specific term dates.[8] The original 1776 constitution created the position of "vice-president", though no provision was made if the office of president became vacant, which occurred four times later. Contemporary sources continue to label the chief executive in such times as the vice president, without any notion of succeeding to the presidency. One acting president, George Bryan, was subsequently recognized later as a full-fledged governor, due to his acting as president for over six months. # Portrait President Took office Left office Vice President 1 Thomas Wharton Jr. March 5, 1777 May 23, 1778 [note 1] George Bryan 2 George Bryan May 23, 1778 December 1, 1778 acting as president [note 2] 3 Joseph Reed December 1, 1778 November 15, 1781 George Bryan [note 3] Matthew Smith [note 3] William Moore 4 William Moore November 15, 1781 November 7, 1782 James Potter 5 John Dickinson November 7, 1782 October 18, 1785 James Ewing James Irvine [note 3] Charles Biddle 6 Benjamin Franklin October 18, 1785 November 5, 1788 Charles Biddle Peter Muhlenberg [note 3] David Redick 7 Thomas Mifflin November 5, 1788 December 21, 1790 George Ross Governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania[edit] Five governors of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who have served since 1995, (left to right): Mark Schweiker, Tom Ridge, Tom Wolf, Tom Corbett and Ed Rendell (January 2015), pose in front of the south facade of the Pennsylvania State Capitol on the Susquehanna River front in Harrisburg at a gubernatorial inauguration The 1790 constitution abolished the council and replaced the president with a governor,[9] and established a three-year term for governor commencing on the third Tuesday of the December following the election, with governors not allowed to serve more than nine out of any twelve years.[10] The 1838 constitution moved the start of the term to the third Tuesday of the January following the election, and allowed governors to only serve six out of any nine years.[11] The 1874 constitution lengthened the term to four years, and prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.[12] The current constitution of 1968 changed this to allow governors to serve two consecutive terms.[13] There are no limits on the number of terms a governor may serve in total as long as there is a four-year break after a second term. Under the earlier 1968 constitution, Milton Shapp was the first governor to serve two terms, and Tom Corbett was the first incumbent governor to lose a re-election bid. If the office of governor becomes vacant through death, resignation, or conviction on impeachment, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term; if the office is only temporarily vacant due to disability of the governor, the lieutenant governor only acts out the duties of governor.[14] Should both offices be vacant, the president "pro tempore" of the state senate becomes governor.[15] The position of a lieutenant governor was created in the 1874 constitution; prior to then, the speaker of the senate would act as governor in cases of vacancy. Originally, the lieutenant governor could only act as governor; it was not until the 1968 constitution that the lieutenant governor could actually become the sitting governor in that fashion. The office of governor has been vacant for an extended period once before, a 17-day gap in 1848 between the resignation of the previous governor and the swearing in of his acting successor. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected on the same political party ticket.[16] Parties Anti-Masonic (1) Democratic (12) Democratic-Republican (6) None (1) Republican (26) Whig (2) # Governor Took office Left office Party Lt.

Even when the first bill was proposed to purchase a home, the word mansion was not used. Rather, the home was and is designated as a "residence." Even during the 79 years that Keystone Hall was used, it was known simply as that, Keystone Hall. Even today, the home located at 2035 North Front Street is officially known as "The Governor's Residence" not "The Governor's Mansion." The distinction may be both psychological and historical. It may help to remind the governor that he lives in the people's house. It may also remind the electorate that the we, as citizens, own the home and allow the individuals we choose to reside there only temporarily. As early as 1852, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives proposed funds for "the erection of a dwelling for the residence of the Governor of this Commonwealth." Six years later, on January 18, 1858, Governor Pollock signed the bill authorizing funds for the purchase of a building suitable for the governor. By 1861 and the start of the Civil War, Governor Curtin found the home to be too small to handle the full load of war-related business. Funds were authorized to purchase 313 North Front Street. Governor Curtin and family moved into the residence in 1864. Twenty years later, the neighboring home was purchased, joined together, and a faux façade was built. Keystone Hall was now a fully functioning residence for the governor. By 1959, the home had fallen into such disrepair that the home was sold and demolished the following year. (The governors used the State House at Indiantown Gap during this period.) Arthur James proposed a new governors residence in 1941. He wanted a grand house built in the William & Mary (Williamsburg) style architecture. However, it took over 25 years for his idea to come to fruition. In 1968, the current residence opened to welcome the Ray Shafer family. It has been the home of the governor ever since. Living former U.S. governors of Pennsylvania[edit] As of January 2018[update], there are five former U.S. governors of Pennsylvania who are currently living at this time, the oldest U.S. governor of Pennsylvania being Dick Thornburgh (served 1979–1987, born 1932). The most recent death of a former U.S. governor of Pennsylvania was that of William Scranton (served 1963–1967, born 1917), on July 28, 2013. The most recently serving U.S. governor of Pennsylvania to die was Bob Casey Sr., (served 1987–1995) on May 30, 2000. Governor Gubernatorial term Date of birth (and age) Dick Thornburgh 1979–1987 (1932-07-16) July 16, 1932 (age 87) Tom Ridge 1995–2001 (1945-08-26) August 26, 1945 (age 74) Mark Schweiker 2001–2003 (1953-01-31) January 31, 1953 (age 67) Ed Rendell 2003–2011 (1944-01-05) January 5, 1944 (age 76) Tom Corbett 2011–2015 (1949-06-17) June 17, 1949 (age 70) See also[edit] List of Pennsylvania gubernatorial elections List of Pennsylvania state legislatures List of colonial governors of Pennsylvania Notes[edit] ^ Died in office. ^ As Vice President of the Supreme Executive Council, acted as president. Four vice presidents acted as president at various times; however, Bryan's lengthy term has caused his term to since be recognized as being equivalent to president. Contemporary sources listed him only as vice president, acting out the duties of president. ^ a b c d Resigned; no reason was recorded by the Supreme Executive Council. ^ The office of lieutenant governor was not created until the 1873 Constitution, first being filled in 1875. ^ The fractional terms of some governors are not to be understood absolutely literally; rather, they are meant to show single terms during which multiple governors served, due to resignations, deaths and the like. ^ The Federalist Party nominated Mifflin, but he himself carried no party label. ^ Mifflin was elected governor three times under the 1790 Constitution, having previously been elected once as President of the Supreme Executive Council. ^ Ritner was the last to serve before the 1838 constitution limited governors to serving six years out of any nine years; that constitution also changed the term to commence the next January from the election, extending Ritner's term by a month. ^ First governor to serve under the 1838 constitution. ^ Resigned due to illness; he died of tuberculosis only 11 days later. ^ Following Francis R. Shunk's resignation, an interregnum of 17 days occurred before the speaker of the state senate, William F. Johnston, was sworn in. ^ As speaker of the state senate, filled unexpired term, and was subsequently elected governor in his own right. ^ First governor under the 1874 constitution, which prevented governors from succeeding themselves and lengthened terms to four years. Since Hartranft was originally elected under the previous constitution, he was allowed to succeed himself. Hartranft's first term was shortened from three to two years to fit the electoral schedule of the new constitution. ^ Resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate. While official sources state Martin resigned on January 3, most contemporary sources reported his resignation as occurring on January 2.[17][18] ^ As lieutenant governor, acted as governor for unexpired term. ^ First governor under the 1968 constitution, and thus eligible to succeed himself. ^ On June 14, 1993, Casey transferred executive authority to Lieutenant Governor Singel, and later that day underwent a heart-liver transplant operation. Singel acted as governor until Casey resumed the powers and duties of the office six months later on December 13, 1993. Because Casey never officially resigned, Singel was only an acting governor. ^ Resigned to be Director of the Office of Homeland Security. ^ As lieutenant governor, filled unexpired term. ^ Died in office. ^ As president pro tempore of the state senate, acted as lieutenant governor.
