Law enforcement agencies may petition ONDCP for designation as a HIDTA, but new applicants typically request to be admitted to the closest-established HIDTA. Applicants can click here for the Executive Directors’ contact information. Criteria for Applying ONDCP has established the following criteria for determining if a county should receive HIDTA designation: The area is a significant center for illegal drug production, manufacturing, importation, or distribution; State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies have committed resources to address the drug trafficking problem in the area, thereby indicating a determination to respond aggressively to the problem; Drug-related activities in the area are having a harmful impact in the area and in other areas of the country; and A significant increase in allocation of Federal resources is necessary to respond adequately to drug-related activities in the area. Petitioning ONDCP for HIDTA status The HIDTA program does not have a pre-set application. Applicants can present their petition to ONDCP for HIDTA designation by presenting relevant information in sections corresponding to the four criteria listed above. More information about the requirements of the petition process can be found here and in the Federal Register. Applicants should direct questions and completed applications to ONDCP_HIDTA@ondcp.eop.gov.
