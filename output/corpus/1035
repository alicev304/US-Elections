Shoup Formation October 1, 1890 Deputy Janice McGeachin Salary $117,000 (2013)[1] Website gov.idaho.gov The Governor of Idaho is the head of the executive branch of Idaho's state government[2] and commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[3] The governor has the duty to see state laws are executed, power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Idaho Legislature.[3] Idaho Territory had 16 territorial governors appointed by the President of the United States from the territory's organization in 1863 until the formation of the state of Idaho in 1890. Four of these never took office, resigning before reaching the territory. 31 individuals have held the office of governor of Idaho since the state's admission to the Union in 1890, two of whom—C. A. Bottolfsen and Cecil Andrus—served non-consecutive terms. The state's first governor, George L. Shoup, had the shortest term of three months, and Cecil Andrus served as governor the longest at 14 years. 4 governors resigned, but none have died while in office. The current governor is Republican Brad Little, who took office on January 7, 2019.

Shoup April 30, 1889[30] – July 3, 1890 Benjamin Harrison Governors of the State of Idaho[edit] Idaho was admitted to the Union on July 3, 1890. Since then, the state has had 32 governors, two of whom served non-consecutive terms. The terms for governor and lieutenant governor are 4 years, commencing on the first Monday in the January following the election.[31] Prior to 1946, the offices were elected to terms of two years.[32] If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is out of state or unable to discharge his duties, the lieutenant governor acts as governor until such time as the disability is removed.[33] If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are vacant or both those officers are unable to fulfill their duties, the President pro tempore of the Idaho Senate is next in line, and then the Speaker of the Idaho House of Representatives.[34] After the change to four-year terms, self-succession (re-election) was not initially allowed; newly elected Governor Robert E. Smylie, formerly the state's attorney general, successfully lobbied the 1955 legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution to allow gubernatorial re-election, which was approved by voters in the 1956 general election.[35][36] There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve.[37] Governors of the State of Idaho No. Governor Term in office Party Election Lt.
