The 2016 United States presidential election in Connecticut was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the 2016 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Connecticut voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. On April 26, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Connecticut voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic and Republican parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated could choose any 1 primary in which to vote, provided they registered with the party they wished to vote with in person by noon the day before. Hillary Clinton won the election in Connecticut with 54.5% of the vote, a reduced margin from President Obama's 58.06% in 2012. Donald Trump, who later went on to win the presidency, received 40.9% of the vote.[1] Clinton carried 6 of the state's 8 counties; however, this was the first time a Republican had won Windham County since George H. W. Bush in 1988.
