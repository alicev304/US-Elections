Presidential memoranda do not have an established process for issuance or publication; unlike executive orders, they are not numbered. A presidential determination is a determination resulting in an official policy or position of the executive branch of the United States government. Presidential determinations may involve any number of actions, including setting or changing policy, or any number of other exercises of executive power.[2] A presidential proclamation is a statement issued by a president on a matter of public policy. They are generally defined as, "the act of causing some state matters to be published or made generally known. A written or printed document in which are contained such matters, issued by proper authority; as the president's proclamation, the governor's, the mayor's proclamation."[3] An administrative order (i.e., findings, letters, orders) can be issued.[4] Administrative orders are published in the Federal Register in forms other than those of executive orders, or proclamations, have been denominated as administrative orders when reproduced in CFR Title 3 compilations."[4] A research guide by the National Archives defined administrative orders as "unnumbered signed documents through which the President of the United States conducts the administrative operations of the Federal Government" which "include but are not limited to memoranda, notices, determinations, letters, and messages."[5] A presidential notice or a presidential sequestration order can also be issued.[6][7] The newest executive power, national security presidential memoranda,2 operate like executive orders, but are only in the area of national security. They date back to President Harry S. Truman and have been called many different names.1[8] Executive orders, presidential memoranda, presidential determinations, presidential proclamations, administrative orders, presidential notices, presidential sequestration orders, and national security presidential memoranda are compiled by the Office of the Federal Register (within the National Archives and Records Administration) and are printed by the Government Printing Office. They are published daily, except on federal holidays. A free source of these documents is the Federal Register, which contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.[9] There are no copyright restrictions on the Federal Register; as a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain.[10] Listed below are executive orders beginning with order number 13765, presidential memoranda, presidential determinations, presidential proclamations, administrative orders, presidential notices, presidential sequestration orders, and national security presidential memoranda signed by U.S. president Donald Trump.

Most of the differences were minor grammatical or typographic changes, but there were "two cases where the original text referred to inaccurate or non-existent provisions of law."[459] This raised concerns among advocates for government transparency; the executive director of the Sunlight Foundation said that the "last-minute edits" to the orders indicated problems with the Trump administration's "vetting, sign-off, and publication processes for executive orders."[459] The inaccuracies also prompted concern because the Federal Register versions of presidential documents are often published several days after they are signed, "meaning that the public must often rely on what the White House puts out."[459] In the order on ethics guidelines for federal appointees, the WhiteHouse.gov section cites "section 207 of title 28, United States Code," which ProPublica found does not exist. The correct citation, made in the Federal Register version, is section 207 of title 18.[460] Presidential determination no. 11 (Respect to the Efforts of Foreign Governments Regarding Trafficking in Persons) is not in whitehouse.gov,40 however, it is in the Federal Register.[395] Gallery[edit] This section contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images.

However, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration ordered their national security directives to be published in the Federal Register.[461] ^ National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directives address continuity of government in the event of a "catastrophic emergency" disrupting the U.S. population, economy, environment, infrastructure and government policy. ^ On April 25, 2017, United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California William Orrick III ruled that Trump exceeded his presidential authority when he signed EO 13768 on January 25, 2017, directing his administration to withhold all federal funding from local jurisdictions deemed to be "sanctuary jurisdictions" including "sanctuary cities" by issuing a preliminary injunction.[462][463][464][465][466] Judge Orrick subsequently issued a nationwide permanent injunction on November 20, 2017, declaring that section 9(a) of Executive Order 13768 was "unconstitutional on its face"[467][468] and violates "the separation of powers doctrine and deprives [the plaintiffs] of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights."[469] ^ Revoked by: EO 13780, of March 16, 2017. ^ Revokes: EO 13769, of March 16, 2017. ^ On March 15, 2017, Judge Derrick Watson of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the government from enforcing several key provisions of the order (Sections 2 and 6). The judge claimed the executive order was likely motivated by anti-Muslim sentiment and thus breached the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. On the same date, Judge Theodore Chuang of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland reached a similar conclusion (enjoining Section 2(c) only). The Department of Justice stated that it "will continue to defend [the] Executive Order in the courts".[470] Shortly following arguments from the state of Hawaii and the Department of Justice, the restraining order was converted by Watson into an indefinite preliminary injunction on March 29.[471][472] ^ United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, refused on May 25, 2017, to reinstate the ban, citing religious discrimination.[473] On June 1, 2017, the Trump administration appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court for the cancellation of the preliminary injunctions and to allow the order to go into effect while the court looks at its ultimate legality later in the year.[474] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court partially lifted the halt and will hear oral arguments for the petition to vacate the injunctions in the fall.[475] ^ Revokes: EO 13673 of July 31, 2014, section 3 of EO 13683 of December 11, 2014, and EO 13738 of August 23, 2016. ^ Revokes: EO 13775 of February 9, 2017. ^ Revokes: EO 13575 (Establishment of the White House Rural Council) of June 9, 2011. ^ Amends: EO 13067 of November 3, 1997; EO 13412 of October 13, 2006; and EO 13761 of January 13, 2017. ^ Revised: Regarding Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline of January 24, 2017.

Watson's decision noted that the latest ban "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor" as it "plainly discriminates based on nationality" and as such violates federal law and "the founding principles of this Nation."[477] ^ Continues: EO 12978 of October 21, 1995. ^ Amends: EO 13223 of September 14, 2001. ^ Presidential Determination No. 2017-15 of September 30, 2017, is not in the White House's official website.

Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102–526, 106 Stat. 3443) stated that the records had to be released after 25 years of the signing date (October 26, 1992). Only 2,800 records of the 29,000 were released on October 26, 2017. The next day, Trump said he would begin to roll out the rest of the records as they were processed and deemed not to raise national security concerns. On November 3, 2017, the National Archives released 676 C.I.A. records.[478] ^ Continues: EO 13413 of October 27, 2006. ^ Continues: EO 13067 of November 3, 1997; Continues expansion: EO 13400 of April 26, 2006; Additional steps were taken in EO 13412 of October 13, 2006, EO 13761 of January 13, 2017, and EO 13804 of July 11, 2017. ^ Continues: EO 12170 of November 14, 1979. ^ Continues: EO 13712 of November 22, 2015. ^ On April 25, 2017, United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California William Orrick III had temporarily imposed a block on EO 13768.[462] On November 20, 2017, Orrick permanently blocked EO 13768 (Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States). With lawsuits brought by San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, Orrick ruled that the Trump administration can't set new conditions on spending approved by Congress.[479][480] Orrick found the order unconstitutional. In the judge's decision, the Trump administration's efforts to move local officials to cooperate with its efforts to deport undocumented immigrants violated the separation of powers doctrine as well as the Fifth and Tenth amendments.[481] Orrick said that the order was written broadly to "reach all federal grants" and potentially jeopardized hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to San Francisco and Santa Clara.[482] ^ Continues: EO 12938 of November 14, 1994. ^ Pub.L. 114–191 signed into law on July 15, 2016. ^ Revokes: EO 11580 of January 20, 1971 (Establishing a Seal for the National Credit Union Administration). ^ US Supreme Court upholds the third travel ban.[483] Citations[edit] ^ Schmidt et al. 2013. ^ Office of the Press Secretary (January 4, 1996).
