The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.

To the extent that a popular vote was held, it was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.

Notes[edit] ^ George Washington, 1788-89, 1792. ^ a b For purposes of these lists, other national candidates are defined as those who won at least one electoral vote, or won at least ten percent of the vote in multiple states. ^ a b c d Won the electoral college while losing the popular vote ^ Was allied with a slate of unpledged electors in Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina ^ Three other candidates ran and received electoral votes nationally as part of the unsuccessful Whig strategy to defeat Martin Van Buren by running four candidates with local appeal in different regions of the country. The others were William Henry Harrison, Hugh Lawson White, and Willie Person Mangum. None of these candidates appeared on the ballot in Massachusetts, whose ballot was the only one where Webster appeared.
