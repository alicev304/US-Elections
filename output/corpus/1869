The President is the chief executive of the United States, with powers and duties enumerated under Article II of the United States Constitution. To be eligible for office, he or she must be a native-born citizen of the United States and a resident thereof for 14 years, and at least 35 years of age. The President and Vice-President are elected together. When Americans vote for President and Vice-President, it should be noted, they do not actually vote for them but for a candidate's electors, who subsequently meet in state capitals after the general election and cast the official votes. Each state is allowed as many electors as it has Senators and Congressmen; thus, California has 54 (52 members of the US House and 2 US Senators) and Delaware has 3 (1 member of the US House and 2 US Senators). A candidate who wins a state's vote, no matter by how small a margin, is entitled to all the electors from that state-- which impacts the manner in which Presidential campaigns are conducted.
