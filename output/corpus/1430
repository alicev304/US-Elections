List of United States major party presidential tickets - Wikipedia
List of United States major party presidential tickets From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article In the United States, political parties nominate one candidate each for President of the United States and for Vice President of the United States. These candidates attempt to win presidential elections by taking a majority of the electoral vote. The two candidates together are known as a ticket. Many states did not hold popular votes for the presidential election prior to the advent of Jacksonian Democracy in the 1820s. Prior to the ratification of the 12th Amendment in 1804, electors cast two votes for president rather than one vote for president and one vote for vice president. Under the pre-12th Amendment Constitution, the candidate with the most votes became president and the candidate with the second most votes became vice president; hence, all candidates were technically running against each other.[1] The listed ages are as of election day; for races prior to 1845, December 1st is considered election day for the purposes of the list.

For these elections, the party's candidate that received the most electoral votes is assigned the position of presidential nominee for the purposes of the table, while the party's candidate that won the second most electoral votes is assigned the position of vice presidential nominee. For these elections, the "electoral vote percentage" column reflects the percentage of electors won by the presidential candidate, rather than the percentage of electoral votes won. ^ a b The results columns reflect the presidential vote. The last column (marked "R") indicates the presidential nominee's ranking in number of electoral votes in that election, with the popular vote breaking ties. ^ This column indicates the type of candidacy. An "I" indicates an incumbent president, "C" indicates a challenger to an incumbent, "O" indicates an open seat (meaning there was no incumbent in the race), and "T" indicates a (post-1800) third party or independent ticket. ^ a b c d This column reflects the candidate's age on election day. For elections held prior to the 1848 presidential election (the first election with a national election day), the column reflects the candidate's age on November 1st of the year of the election. ^ Shriver replaced the original Democratic vice presidential nominee, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, after the latter withdrew from the ticket. Eagleton remains the only major party nominee to withdraw from the ticket after being nominated.[5] ^ Sherman died before election day, and Nicholas M. Butler received the electoral votes that would have gone to Sherman had he lived.[5] ^ Bryan was also the Populist nominee in 1896; Thomas E. Watson was his running mate on the Populist ticket. Bryan's popular and electoral vote numbers reflect his combined vote on both the Democratic and Populist tickets. ^ Greeley and Brown were nominated by the Liberal Republican Party and were subsequently nominated by the Democratic Party at their national convention. Greeley died shortly after the election, but before the electoral votes were cast. Most of the electoral votes that would have been cast for Greeley instead went to former Indiana Senator Thomas A. Hendricks or Benjamin Gratz Brown. Greeley's EV% reflects what he would have won had he lived and if there were no faithless electors. ^ For the 1864 election, the Republican Party temporarily adopted the name of the National Union Party in hopes of attracting War Democrats and other Unionists. ^ a b The Democratic Party held three national conventions in 1860. The first produced a deadlock and the second nominated Douglas. A group of Southern Democrats bolted from the second convention and held a third convention, which nominated Breckinridge. The Breckinridge-Lane ticket is often labelled as the "Southern Democratic" ticket while the Douglas-Johnson ticket is sometimes labelled as the "Northern Democratic" ticket. ^ Van Buren campaigned without a running mate as the party refused to re-nominate Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson but was unable to agree on an alternative. A majority of Van Buren's electors ultimately cast their vice presidential vote for Johnson. ^ Though Van Buren won a majority of electoral votes, Johnson only won a plurality as Virginia's electors voted for Van Buren for president and William Smith for vice president. Under the terms of the 12th Amendment, the Senate held a contingent election to elect the vice president, which Johnson won. ^ a b c d As the Whig Party was unable to unite around a single candidate, three Whigs ran for president in the 1836 presidential election; there was only one Whig ticket in each state.[7] William Henry Harrison was the Whig candidate in fifteen states, most of which were in the North, Hugh Lawson White was the Whig candidate in nine states, all of which were in the South, and Daniel Webster was the Whig candidate in Massachusetts. Additionally, Willie Person Mangum received the electoral votes of South Carolina, where the legislature determined the allocation of electoral votes. Despite facing multiple opponents, Democrat Martin Van Buren won re-election with a majority of the electoral vote. ^ a b c d Whigs electors spread their votes among two vice presidential candidates in 1836. Francis Granger won most of the electoral votes cast by electors that voted for Harrison and Webster, while John Tyler won the electoral votes of White and Mangum supporters. ^ a b c d In 1824, the Democratic-Republicans failed to agree on one candidate, and four Democratic-Republican candidates received electoral votes. No candidate won a majority of the electoral vote, so the House of Representatives conducted a contingent election under the terms of the 12th Amendment. The House chose between the three candidates with the most electoral votes, which were Jackson, Adams, and Crawford. Adams won the contingent election. ^ a b c d In 1824, several vice presidential candidates received electoral votes, but Calhoun won a majority of the electoral vote for vice president. Calhoun is italicized in the table because he appears twice for the same election. ^ Monroe was essentially unopposed in the election. A faithless elector, William Plumer, cast an electoral vote for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, while unpledged Federalist electors and the independent candidacy of DeWitt Clinton won a small portion of the popular vote. ^ Clinton was supported by a mix of anti-Madison Democratic-Republicans and Federalists. Clinton himself remained in the Democratic-Republican Party. His running mate, Ingersoll, was a Federalist. ^ Jefferson tied his running mate, Burr, in electoral votes. As Jefferson and Burr tied, the House held a contingent election between Jefferson and Burr. Jefferson won the contingent election to become president, while Burr became vice president. ^ Though Adams won election as president, Pinckney did not win election as vice president. Instead, Thomas Jefferson won election as vice president since he had the second most electoral votes. In addition to Pinckney and Adams, five other Federalists received electoral votes. ^ a b Though Washington was essentially unopposed, Adams faced competition for the second most electoral votes in both 1789 and 1792. In 1789, Adams's strongest competition came from John Jay of New York, while in 1792 Adams's strongest opposition came from George Clinton of New York. ^ a b Byrd and Thurmond did not seek national office in 1960, but received the votes of unpledged electors from Mississippi and Alabama. ^ Cranfill was allowed to appear on state ballots despite the fact that he was constitutionally ineligible to be vice president due to his age.

Ballot Access News. Retrieved 7 September 2017. ^ Floyd did not actively campaign in the 1832 presidential election. He won the votes of South Carolina, where the legislature appointed electors. ^ Clinton did not actively seek office in 1820. ^ Most Federalists supported DeWitt Clinton in 1812, but King received some votes as a "straight Federalist." ^ a b The New York legislature split its presidential electoral votes between James Madison and George Clinton, and its vice presidential electoral votes between Monroe and Madison. ^ A group known as the tertium quids supported Monroe, but Monroe did not actively contest the election.

The South Carolina legislature continued to choose presidential electors until 1868, but, with only a small number of exceptions, all other states held popular votes after the 1828 election.
