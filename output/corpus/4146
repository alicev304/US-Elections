These include Make Everything Great Again, a street art mural by Dominykas Čečkauskas and Mindaugas Bonanu depicting Trump French kissing Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia,[3] and The Emperor Has No Balls, a series of sculptures depicting a nude Trump by the anarchist collective Indecline.[4] Cuban artist Edel Rodriguez painted a series of anti-Trump artworks for various magazines including Time Magazine and Der Spiegel.[5] Illma Gore also created a piece titled Make America Great Again, which depicted Trump naked. The artwork was censored on social media sites, delisted from eBay and refused by galleries in the United States due to security concerns. It attracted bids of over £100,000 after going on display at Maddox Gallery in Mayfair, London, although the artist was anonymously threatened with legal action.[6] Comics[edit] Since 1986, he has been depicted in the Doonesbury comic strip by Garry Trudeau,[7][8] prompting an unfavorable response from Trump.[9] In 2016, the Trump-strips were released as a paperback, Yuge!: 30 Years of Doonesbury on Trump.[10] Trump was also depicted in Berkeley Breathed's long-running political cartoon strip, Bloom County, since 1989 where his brain was placed inside the body of Bill the Cat after being hit by an anchor on his yacht, Trump Princess.[11][12] In 1990, a Dilbert comic strip indirectly referred to Trump as 'God of Capitalism'. [13] During the 2016 election, various comic artists satirized Trump and his campaign.[14][15] For example, following Pepe the Frog's association to the Trump campaign and the alt-right, Matt Furie published a satirical take of his appropriation on The Nib.[16][17] Films[edit] Main article: Donald Trump filmography Donald Trump and Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.

The screening went ahead, with the BBC defending the decision and stating that Trump had refused the opportunity to take part in the film.[33] In 2016, Funny or Die released a parody film called Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie with Johnny Depp portraying Trump.[34] Literature[edit] Main article: Bibliography of Donald Trump Donald Trump, along with the Trump Tower, is depicted in the 1986 book I'll Take Manhattan.[35] Trump himself appears in the 1987 miniseries adaptation.[36][37] A parody of Trump is the main villain in the 1992 The Destroyer novel Ghost in the Machine.[38][39] The erotic novel Trump Tower (2011) includes Trump as a character.

It begins "Combover ... twitter-rat, tweet-twat, tripe-gob, muckspout", includes the expressions "tie-treader", and "mandrake mymmerkin", and ends "welcome to the White House".[44] Music[edit] Main article: Donald Trump in music Since the 1980s, Donald Trump's wealth and lifestyle have been a fixture of hip hop lyrics,[45] his name being quoted by more than 50 artists.[46] In 2011, rapper Mac Miller released his "Donald Trump" song about rising to Trump-level riches, which became a Billboard hit.[45] The billionaire subsequently requested royalties for using his name, starting a feud with Miller.[47] In 2016, rapper YG released a single titled "FDT", referring to Trump in a disparaging manner. In November 2019, Trump visited Madison Square Garden where people yelled the lyrics of the song at him.[48] Television[edit] Taran Killam (left) and Darrell Hammond (right), respectively, portray Donald Trump while the real Donald Trump (middle) hosted Saturday Night Live on November 7, 2015 Since 1988, Trump and members of his family have been parodied on Saturday Night Live (SNL).[49][50] He has hosted SNL twice, in 2004 and 2015.[51] Trump is one of four presidents who have appeared on Saturday Night Live, and the only president to have hosted the show.[52] On SNL, Trump has been impersonated by several people, including Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond and Alec Baldwin.

Writer Dan Greaney said in 2016: "What we needed was for Lisa to have problems beyond her fixing, that everything went as bad as it possibly could, and that's why we had Trump be president before her. That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was consistent with the vision of America going insane".[58] After Donald Trump won the 2016 election, The Simpsons used the phrase "Being Right Sucks" in a chalkboard gag.[59] Trump hosted the game show The Apprentice and its spin-off The Celebrity Apprentice between 2004 and 2015. Further TV-projects have at times been announced and cancelled, such as Trump Tower (Showtime in 1998 and Lifetime in 2008),[60] The Tower and Trump Takeover.[60] Trump is portrayed in a 2005 episode of American Dad, demanding money for the use of his The Apprentice catchphrase "You´re fired!"[61] In February 2005, a parody of Trump ("Donald Grump") appeared on Sesame Street.[62][63] Trump appears in the 2010 documentary-drama America: The Story of Us.[64] In April 2011, Trump attended the White House Correspondents' Dinner, featuring comedian Seth Meyers. President Barack Obama used the occasion to present several prepared jokes mocking Trump. Retrospectively, Trump claimed "I didn't feel humiliated, I had a great time. So the press is very dishonest, they don't report the truth and therefore it's just easier not to go."[65][66] A parody of Trump is president of Canada in a 2015 episode of South Park, Where My Country Gone?[67][68] In later episodes Mr. Garrison changes into a more Trump-like persona.[69][70] Jimmy Fallon has done impressions of Trump on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon since 2015.[71] On February 28, 2016, Trump was the subject of a segment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver that was named after him. The segment, hosted by comedian John Oliver, was critical of Trump.[72][73][74] Trump was also featured in later Last Week Tonight segments, including one regarding Trump's plans for a border wall on May 20,[75][76] and another regarding Trump University.[77] On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert frequently features a caricature of Trump, called "Cartoon Donald Trump". Colbert's reasoning for including a cartoon version of Trump is because he felt that Trump had resorted to "almost cartoonish tactics".[78] Meanwhile, on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, host Jimmy Kimmel wrote two Dr. Seuss-like books: Winners Aren't Losers and its sequel Winners Still Aren't Losers. Both of these books were featured when Trump was the guest star. On the show, Kimmel would read it out loud to Trump, having Trump read the last word on both occasions.[79][80] Vic Berger, a frequent collaborator for the comedy duo Tim & Eric, created a series of Trump related videos for Super Deluxe. Each of these videos remix various Trump debate appearances with air horns and crowds chanting Trump's name.[81][82][83] The 2016 web series You Got Trumped: The First 100 Days takes a darkly comic look at what President Donald J. Trump's first one hundred days in office would look like. The series stars John Di Domenico as Trump and Ron Sparks as Chris Christie, his "whipping boy".[84] The President Show, starring Anthony Atamanuik as Trump and Peter Grosz as Mike Pence, debuted on Comedy Central on April 27, 2017.[85] Atamanuik started impersonating Trump in 2015.[86] Trump was portrayed negatively in the anime adaptation of Inuyashiki, played by Bill Fleming, where he dismisses the lives that will be lost from an incoming meteor strike.[87] Trump also makes a brief appearance in the anime Devilman Crybaby.[88] Trump is portrayed by Herson Andrade in the Mexican political parody show El Privilegio de Mandar.[89] Archived footage of Donald Trump's 2016 U.S. presidential campaign announcement was used in the Arrested Development episode "Self-Deportation" (season 5, episode 2).[90] Family Guy portrayed Trump in a 2019 episode. Peter has been hired by Trump and the family moves to Washington.[91] Hair[edit] "Donald Trump's hair" redirects here. For the song and the music album by that name, see Kacey Jones § Discography. Trump's hairstyle, 2017 Trump's hairstyle has been mentioned frequently by the media. His hairstyle has been described as a comb-over.[92] In 2004, the Chicago Tribune wrote that Trump is "known for his gaudy casinos and unusual mane of copper hair."[93] David Letterman made a joke about Trump's hair in 2008, likening it to a Chihuahua.[94] During a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone, Trump said, "I get a lot of credit for comb-overs. But it's not really a comb-over. It's sort of a little bit forward and back. I've combed it the same way for years. Same thing, every time."[95] A gallery of photographs depicting Trump's hairstyle across four decades was published in 2015.[96] In various late-night talk shows and interviews, Trump's hair has humorously been suggested to be a wig, so he has let the interviewers touch his hair[97] to verify its authenticity.[98][99] In 2009, singer Kacey Jones released a song titled "Donald Trump's Hair",[100] which reached #1 on ReverbNation's comedy charts.[101] In early 2011, Vanity Fair wrote that Trump would run for president in 2012,[102] and did a series of pieces satirically comparing the birther controversy over the authenticity of incumbent president Obama's short-form birth certificate to a hypothetical 'balders' controversy over the authenticity of Trump's hair.[103][104][105] In a June 2015 speech for his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said he would change his hair style if he were elected.[106] Vanity Fair published two claymation videos making fun of Trump's anthropomorphized hair in late 2015.[107][108] In 2017, the physician to the president Ronny Jackson stated that Trump took daily doses of Propecia, a branded treatment for the prevention of male-pattern hair loss.[109] In Michael Wolff's 2018 book Fire and Fury, Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump allegedly described the mechanics of her father's hair as "an absolutely clean pate — a contained island after scalp-reduction surgery — surrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are drawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray,” and the color as "[coming] from a product called Just For Men — the longer it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump’s orange-blond hair color."[110][better source needed] In September 2016, Jimmy Fallon invited Donald Trump to be a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Trump was asked by Jimmy if he could mess up his hair. Donald Trump agreed to the offer and allowed Jimmy to mess his hair up. Following the hair incident, Jimmy was accused by critics that he was humanizing Trump after Trump had pressed more on the Zero-tolerance policy under the Trump administration. Trump later tweeted ".@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous “hair show” with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have “humanized” me-he is taking heat. He called & said “monster ratings.” Be a man Jimmy!". Following that tweet, Jimmy quickly tweeted back saying that he will donate to the RAICES charity in an effort to help families being separated at the border.[111] In February 2018, a video shot of Trump boarding Air Force One against a gust of wind clearly showed the comb-over. The video went viral and was critiqued on the internet.[112][113] See also[edit] List of things named after Donald Trump Media career of Donald Trump References[edit] ^ Conley, Kevin (April 20, 2016).
