List of United States governors From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from List of current United States governors) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Party affiliation of current United States governors: Democratic Republican New Progressive The following is a list of current governors of U.S. states and territories. In the United States, a governor is the chief executive officer of a state or a territory. The partisan affiliations of American governors are close to being evenly split among the fifty states. As of January 2020, there are 24 states with Democratic governors and 26 states with Republican governors. Additionally, three U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands) have Democratic governors, while one (the Northern Mariana Islands) has a Republican governor. Wanda Vázquez Garced of Puerto Rico is a member of the New Progressive Party, although she is also affiliated with the Republican Party.
