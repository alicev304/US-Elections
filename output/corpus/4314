Clinton lost every county in the state to Bernie Sanders. Sanders's West Virginia victory came from strong support among workers in the coal industry; fifty-five percent of West Virginia's Democratic voters with coal workers in their households voted for Sanders, while only 29 percent voted for Clinton.[9] His easy win was likely fueled by Clinton's comments in March about coal, "We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business."[10] Analysts speculate Sanders's win in West Virginia came not from support for his own coal policies, but from a rejection of the Obama administration's.[11] Sanders was also helped by large numbers of Republican cross-over voters. Thirty-nine percent of Sanders voters stated they planned to vote for Donald Trump over Sanders in the November general election.[12] References[edit] ^ "Overwhelming support for Trump, small lead for Sanders in MetroNews West Virginia Poll".
