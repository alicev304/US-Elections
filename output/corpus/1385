Since its admission to statehood in 1820, Maine has participated in every U.S. presidential election. Prior to 1820, much of the territory currently comprising the state of Maine was part of the state of Massachusetts, and citizens residing in that area have thus been able to participate in every U.S. election. Since 1972 Maine has split its Electoral votes between its two congressional districts.[1] Winners of the state are in bold.

The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.

Election of 1824[edit] The election of 1824 was a complex realigning election following the collapse of the prevailing Democratic-Republican Party, resulting in four different candidates each claiming to carry the banner of the party, and competing for influence in different parts of the country. The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.

The popular vote was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.
