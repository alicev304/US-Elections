see moon perspective apollo 13 astronaut 0108 cnnon evening april 13 50 year ago nasa astronaut james lovell jr john swigert jr fred haise jr go sleep night apollo 13 command module 200000 mile away earth way moon everything change ultimately force crew abort mission happen accord newly release interview nasa astronaut explosion astronaut just finish tv broadcast provide tour lunar module land moon read ground houstons mission control center apollo 13 flight director gene kranz team hand another shift gene kranz wear famous white vest sit houstons mission operations control room watch fred haise television broadcast space fourth television broadcast audio mission crew ask stir liquid oxygen tank swigert flip switch explosion crackle audio apollo 13 command module houston weve problem lovell say lovell picture lunar module tv broadcast hear loud bang reverberate little echo vehicle metal haise say new nasa documentary apollo 13 home safe haise compare barrel hit side sledgehammer one oxygen tank explode rupture another lovell recall see two three fuel cell develop oxygen go experience apollo 13 mission realtime 50th anniversary drift window look window lovell recently tell nasas houston podcast tell now see escape high rate speed gaseous substance back spacecraft dawn yes lose something look oxygen gauge one read zero one go apollo 13 comprise three main component command module house crew act control center enable earth service module supply oxygen power water main propulsion maneuvering system spacecraft lunar module enable land moon explosion impact service module effectively kill remove necessary item contain mission result command module power die without earth crew know longer land moon now figure get back earth apollo mission control center restore former glory sick stomach disappointment know pretty quick aborted mission haise tell nasas houston podcast crew mission control team act quickly command module 15 minute power leave save battery power reserve reentry work shift everything include navigation command module lunar module short time mean land moon hold two man two day ultimately hold three man four day astronaut mission control decide use lifeboat crew crew make several burn use course correction put right path send back towards earth lovell haise swigert swing around moon lunar module engine help land lift lunar landing instead use put path use moon gravity send back toward earth back side moon astronaut lose contact mission control expect lovell see moon apollo 8 mission swigert haise see first time photograph like tourist haise say astronaut capture image crater 302 farside moon 130 mile surface give larger span moon shoot haise tell houston podcast farouk elbaz one trainer lunar geology lunar scene tell afterwards shoot good picture shoot think try make feel good something right mission home another burn need loop around moon without spacecraft drift far astronaut miss earth wide swing mission become astronaut home soon possible limited resource time run shut everything necessary life support system lunar module temperature drop reach 38 degree fahrenheit day expect land earth haise recall water everywhere build wiring window wall instrument panel impossible like inside apollo 11 mission control keep warm haise lovell don boot wear surface moon swigert put spare underwear put spacesuit trap moisture inside also issue carbon dioxide man exhale cramped quarter lunar module carbon dioxide canister quickly fill mission control engineer scramble come solution send instruction astronaut use material spacecraft like plastic bag tape cardboard able build connection lithium hydroxide canister lunar module command module system plastic bag tape carboard use clear carbon dioxide lunar module lithium hydroxide canister able clear carbon dioxide within hour carbon dioxide level lunar module drop three put thing together god work lovell tell houston podcast perfect example team work think sort outside box also slow try rush thing get rid carbon dioxide safely get home otherwise end ground mission control team run simulator determine astronaut reenter earths atmosphere land none previous simulation lead mission prepare also power command module jettison dead service module move lunar module back command module lose lunar lander lunar module lifeboat heat shield useless reentry lovell take photo severe damage service module jettison jettison service module lovell take photo one whole side spacecraft miss hear say mission audio see material hang space base engine nasas apollo space mission change photographic history astronaut adjust angle spacecraft precise two degree need keep bounce earths atmosphere burning upon reentry lovell say without computer display system use earth sun position orientation pitch three astronaut work together make correction angle entry spacecraft parachute open reentry applause crackle audio mission control mission control erupt cheer applause apollo 13 astronaut earth look back flight director kranz glynn lunney realize everyone need work together previous mission comfortable one another trust never really converge point feel really total control go kranz say apollo 13 home safe time turn corner something new show question get entire world gear orientate one single job get crew home boy team work great kranz say really happen open book tell deal lunney say need coaching just happen pull look back lovell say positivity keep astronaut go aborted mission haise reflect journey 50 year later recent reminiscence nasa houston podcast uss iwo jima prime recovery ship apollo 13 mission crewmember left astronaut fred w haise jr wave lunar module pilot john l swigert jr command module pilot james lovell jr commander transport helicopter ship follow smooth splashdown look get get home lovell say long get one crisis another keep know think positive finally make landing explosion occur just right time make sure get safely explosion occur wed already get high velocity go moon wed probably go around moon come back home think lunar module electrical capacity get home explosion occur lunar orbit know around lunar surface well strand moon nasa loneliest man far astronaut michael collins cathedral apollo 11 ironically mission deem successful failure astronaut safely earth even though lunar landing aborted bring renew interest nasa spaceflight public previous successful flight like apollo 11 make lunar landing seem normal lovell say previous lesson learn illfated apollo 1 mission also save astronaut apollo 13 apollo 1 fire significant redesign include rewiring command module mean wiring waterproof command lunar module prevent electrical shortage water build temperature drop haise say james lovell jr commander john l swigert jr command module pilot fred w haise jr lunar module pilot leave right take crew photo mission ultimate lesson man carry away apollo 13 true teamwork achieve really learn suddenly problem just know close eye hope miracle come miracle something people help lovell say search us crime justice energy environment extreme weather space science world africa americas asia
