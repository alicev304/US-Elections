This information is no more specific than the state in which you are located. • Photos/Media/Files: This permission allows the app to cache images locally, reducing load times for pages you revisit. • Wi-Fi connection information: This item gives the app permission to use available Wi-Fi networks rather than your mobile network. In the absence of trusted Wi-Fi networks or if Wi-Fi is disabled, the app will make use of your cellular network (if available).
