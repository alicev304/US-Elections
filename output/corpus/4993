Arkansas voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Despite Hillary Clinton having once served as First Lady of Arkansas for 12 years as the wife of then Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton, Donald Trump won the state with 60.57% of the vote, and Hillary Clinton received 33.65% of the vote.[1] The Republican candidate has carried Arkansas in every election since 2000. This is also the first election that the state has simultaneously voted for a Republican presidential candidate and an incumbent Republican senate candidate. Arkansas was also one of eleven states that voted twice for Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996 which Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. Trump's 60.57% of the vote is tied with Mitt Romney's 60.57% in the 2012 election, making both candidate's performances the best result for the Republican Party in Arkansas since Richard Nixon in 1972, although Trump bested Romney in terms of margin, winning by 26.92% versus Romney's 23.69%. The Prohibition Party candidate, James Hedges, had the notable achievement of finishing third in Arkansas County, ahead of the major third party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. It was also the only county in the country where he did so.
