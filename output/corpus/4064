Ambassadorships are often used as a form of political patronage to reward high-profile or important supporters of the president. The most visible ambassadorships are often distributed either in this way or to the president's ideological or partisan confreres. Most ambassadorships, however, are assigned to foreign service officers who have spent their career in the State Department. Regardless, all ambassadors must be formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. While all ambassadors serve at the president's pleasure and may be dismissed at any time, career diplomats usually serve tours of roughly three years before receiving a new assignment, and political appointees customarily tender their resignations upon the inauguration of a new president. The rules of the Senate require that when the term of a Senate expires (in the case of the 115th Congress, on January 2, 2019), nominations then pending lapse and are returned to the president, who can resubmit them to the new Congress.[1] Contents 1 Color key 2 Ambassadors to foreign states 2.1 Americas 2.2 Africa 2.3 Middle East 2.4 Asia 2.5 Europe 2.6 Oceania 3 Ambassadors to international organizations 3.1 Ambassador and representatives to the United Nations and related organizations 3.2 Ambassadors and representatives to other international organizations 4 Ambassadors-at-large 5 References Color key[edit] Denotes appointees confirmed by the Senate.
