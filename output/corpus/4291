She carried all counties and won across all demographics, income levels and educational attainment levels. The key to Clinton's success, however, was an 89-11 showing among African American voters, who made up 71% of the Democratic electorate in the state.[4] Mississippi gave Clinton her largest win in any state during the 2016 primaries.[5] References[edit] ^ "MISSISSIPPI 2016 PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SURVEY TOPLINES" (PDF).
