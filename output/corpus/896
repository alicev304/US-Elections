Considered an early American third party, it was started by John C. Calhoun sometime in May–December 1828. The Nullifier Party was a states' rights, pro-slavery party that supported the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, holding that states could nullify federal laws within their borders and that slavery should remain legal. It narrowly missed claiming the unofficial title of being the first ever third party to be created within the United States—that title belongs to the Anti-Masonic Party, which was created in New York in February 1828. The Nullifier Party had several members in both houses of the Congress between 1831 and 1839. Calhoun outlined the principles of the party in his South Carolina Exposition and Protest (1828), a reaction to the "Tariff of Abominations" passed by Congress and signed into law by President John Quincy Adams. The party supported Calhoun's ally John Floyd of Virginia for President in the 1832 election and the state legislature gave Floyd South Carolina's 11 electoral votes, even though Floyd was not a candidate and had himself unsuccessfully tried to convince Calhoun to run for President. As for the party's candidate for Vice President, the Massachusetts based political economist Henry Lee was selected. After President Andrew Jackson left office, Calhoun and most of his followers joined the Democratic Party.
