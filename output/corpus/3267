While the virus knows no race, sex, or class, those with the least are getting hurt the most. Asian communities are facing a surge in racist attacks while the Black and Latinx communities have been disproportionately impacted in mortalities and unemployment. It's time we stand together to rise together. We are, afterall, #AllAmericans. Support COVID-19 relief with independent businesses by purchasing #AllAmericans products whose proceeds go towards rectifying the pandemic. Share your #AllAmericans story to amplify the movement.
