On the same day, the Democratic Party held caucuses in Idaho and Utah, while the Republican Party held primaries in two states, including their own Arizona primary and a primary in American Samoa.

There was controversy surrounding the Arizona primary elections of 2016, specifically having to do with the decrease in polling places in Maricopa County from 200 in 2012 to only 60 in 2016, enacted by Republican officials despite the number of registered voters having increased from 300,000 in 2012 to 800,000 in 2016.[2][3] This decrease in polling places was most pronounced in minority neighborhoods, most notably Latino neighborhoods, with areas like Central Phoenix having only one polling place for 108,000 voters. There were also reports of voters who had been previously registered coming up as unregistered or registered as an independent, making them ineligible to vote in the closed primary.[2] Voters who did manage to vote had to stand in long lines to cast their ballots, some for as long as five hours.[4] Additionally, voters reported being required to vote with a provisional ballot.[5] In 2005, Arizona threw out 27,878 provisional ballots, counting only about 72.5% of the total provisional ballots reported.[6] This was the first election in the state of Arizona since the 2013 Supreme Court decision to strike down Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which would have previously required states with a history of voter discrimination, including Arizona, to receive Federal approval before implementing any changes to voting laws and practices. In Maricopa County, Republican officials have conducted voter purges that disproportionately affected poor and minority areas.[7] Within a day after the election took place on March 22, a petition went viral on the White House petitions site asking the Department of Justice to investigate voter suppression and election fraud in Arizona.[8] The petition reached 100,000 signatures in 40 hours,[9] and as of June 5, 2016, nearly 220,000 people have signed the petition. The White House responded on May 20, 2016. In addition, Phoenix mayor Greg Stanton asked the Justice Department to launch an investigation into the allegations of voter suppression.[10] Both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, as well as the Democratic National Committee, sued the Arizona state government over the alleged voter suppression.[11] The Department of Justice has since launched a federal investigation into the primary.[12] Opinion polling[edit] See also: Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries Poll source Date 1st 2nd Other Official Primary results March 22, 2016 Hillary Clinton 56.3% Bernie Sanders 41.4% Others 2.3% Merrill Poll[13] Margin of error: ± 5.4% Sample size: 300 March 7-11, 2016 Hillary Clinton 50% Bernie Sanders 24% Others / Undecided 26% MBQF Consulting and Marson Media[14] Margin of error: ± 3.6% Sample size: 739 Published February 29, 2016 Hillary Clinton 56% Bernie Sanders 22% Others / Undecided 22% Behavior Research Center[15] Margin of error: ± 7.3% Sample size: 186 October 24 – November 5, 2015 Hillary Clinton 47% Bernie Sanders 19% Martin O'Malley 2% Uncommitted 32% One America News[16] Margin of error: ± 4.7% Sample size: 427 Published August 17, 2015 Hillary Clinton 56% Bernie Sanders 34% Joe Biden 6% Lincoln Chafee 2% Jim Webb 1% Martin O'Malley 1% Public Policy Polling [17] Margin of error: ± 6% Sample size: 268 May 1–3, 2015 Hillary Clinton 58% Bernie Sanders 16% Lincoln Chafee 5% Jim Webb 5% Martin O'Malley 4% Not sure 12% Results[edit] See also: Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries e • d 2016 Democratic Party's presidential nominating process in Arizona – Summary of results – Candidate Popular vote Estimated delegates Count Percentage Pledged Unpledged Total Hillary Clinton 262,459 56.29% 42 6 48 Bernie Sanders 192,962 41.39% 33 1 34 Martin O'Malley (withdrawn) 3,877 0.83% Roque "Rocky" De La Fuente 2,797 0.60% Michael Steinberg 2,295 0.49% Henry Hewes 1,845 0.40% Uncommitted N/A 3 3 Total 466,235 100% 75 10 85 Source: The Green Papers, Arizona Secretary of State Detailed results per congressional district[edit] Detailed results for the Arizona Democratic primary, April 5, 2016[18][19] District Total Hillary Clinton Bernie Sanders Votes Delegates Votes % Delegates Votes % Delegates 1st district 63,863 6 35,445 55.50% 3 26,267 41.13% 3 2nd district 78,237 8 42,797 54.70% 4 33,891 43.32% 4 3rd district 51,520 5 30,298 58.81% 3 20,091 39.00% 2 4th district 37,273 4 15,289 55.43% 2 20,662 41.02% 2 5th district 40,847 5 22,973 56.24% 3 16,982 41.57% 2 6th district 50,465 6 29,266 57.99% 4 20,259 40.14% 2 7th district 42,199 5 24,245 57.45% 3 17,173 40.70% 2 8th district 46,491 5 27,672 59.52% 3 17,651 37.97% 2 9th district 55,340 6 29,101 52.59% 3 25,359 45.82% 3 At-large delegates 466,235 16 262,459 56.29% 9 192,962 41.39% 7 Pledged PLEOs 466,235 9 262,459 56.29% 5 192,962 41.39% 4 Total 466,235 75 262,464 56.29% 42 192,965 41.39% 33 Results by county[edit] County[20] Clinton % Sanders % Apache 4,450 66.4% 1,933 28.8% Cochise 4,654 56.5% 3,265 39.7% Coconino 5,738 44.1% 6,941 53.4% Gila 2,196 59.2% 1,305 35.2% Graham 937 49.1% 851 44.6% Greenlee 497 54.6% 325 35.7% La Paz 309 51.7% 259 43.3% Maricopa 126,988 58.1% 86,942 39.8% Mohave 4,170 56.4% 2,847 38.5% Navajo 4,415 59.7% 2,621 35.4% Pima 56,317 57.3% 40,228 40.9% Pinal 9,771 62.1% 5,414 34.4% Santa Cruz 2,496 65.8% 1,205 31.8% Yavapai 8,401 52.9% 7,108 44.7% Yuma 4,358 63.7% 2,156 31.5% Total 262,459 56.29% 192,962 41.39% Analysis[edit] A Clinton win in Arizona was expected; she had beat Barack Obama in the state eight years earlier by a similar wide margin, and she generally performed well with minority voters in the 2016 primaries. She won in counties with high populations of Hispanic voters, including the largest county Maricopa where the capital city of Phoenix is located, and she also performed well in counties with large populations of Native Americans including Apache County and Navajo County. Sanders won only in Coconino County.[21] Bernie Sanders made a late play for the state of Arizona, including airing Spanish-language ads featuring Congressman Raúl Grijalva.[22] Hillary Clinton offset his efforts with advertising featuring former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords,[22] and airing radio ads in the Navajo language.[23] References[edit] ^ Arizona Secretary of State ^ a b Eugene Scott.
