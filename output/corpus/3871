Stein was immediately the front-runner and was described by the media as "steamrolling to victory."[6] On June 15, 2016, the Stein campaign announced that it had received 203 delegates, enough to win the nomination on the first ballot at the 2016 Green National Convention.[7] A week before the start of the convention, former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner, who served as a surrogate for Senator Bernie Sanders during his campaign, announced that she had been in discussions with the Stein campaign about possibly serving as Stein's vice presidential pick.[8] The following day, Stein stated that the campaign hadn't chosen a VP candidate yet, and was in discussion with several individuals. On August 1, the Stein campaign announced that Ajamu Baraka had been chosen as Stein's VP candidate.[9] Stein released the names of the final six individuals she had considered as her running mate, with Baraka being the choice. The six contenders for Stein's running mate were:[10] Ajamu Baraka, founding executive director of the US Human Rights Network and associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies Aaron Dixon, former captain of the Seattle chapter of the Black Panther Party Dr. Margaret Flowers, former pediatrician, radio host, healthcare activist, and candidate for the United States Senate election in Maryland, 2016 Chris Hedges, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author Nina Turner, former Ohio State Senator Kevin Zeese, former executive director of National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws[citation needed] See also[edit] Green Party of the United States Green Party presidential primaries, 2016 Green National Convention Other parties' presidential nominating conventions in 2016: Democratic Libertarian Republican References[edit] ^ Winger, Richard (August 2, 2015) "Green Party Will Hold Presidential Convention in Houston", Ballot Access News.
