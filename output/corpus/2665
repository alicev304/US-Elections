In drug courts, judges, prosecutors, treatment providers, defense attorneys, probation and law enforcement officers work together to help those struggling with substance use and mental health disorders receive the treatment they need to achieve lasting recovery. Research shows drug courts reduce recidivism and crime while saving money. In addition, drug courts have been found to improve housing, employment, family reunification and financial stability. The Office of National Drug Control Policy’s Drug Court Training and Technical Assistance (TTA) grant seeks to enhance and increase adoption of this model by providing governments and drug courts at the state and local levels the tools they need to develop, maintain, and enhance evidence-based interventions. The recipient of the 2018 – 2020 TTA grant is the National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP), a national membership organization which supports over 30,000 justice and treatment professionals at over 3,000 courts with training, consultation, and technical assistance. The 2018-2020 TTA grant supported the following NADCP initiatives: Pocket guides on medication-assisted treatment to educate drug court clinicians, team members and participants; The utilization of the NADCP Adult Drug Court Best Practice Standards in all training programs and publications; Training and technical assistance to ensure fidelity to the drug court model; A dynamic toolkit to address equity and inclusion in drug courts; and The ARK, an online tool that assesses an individual’s risk profile and provides recommendations on evidence-based and promising programs matched to that individual.
