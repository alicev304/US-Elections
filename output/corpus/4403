The winner of the election would serve a term from January 1, 1999 until January 1, 2003. Incumbent Republican Governor Gary Johnson was re-elected to a second term. As of 2019, this is the last time a non-Hispanic was elected Governor of New Mexico. In his campaign, Johnson promised to continue the policies of his first term: improving schools; cutting state spending, taxes, and bureaucracy; and frequent use of his veto and line-item veto power.[1] Fielding a strong Hispanic candidate in a 40% Hispanic state, the Democrats were expected to oust Johnson,[2] but Johnson won by a margin of 55% to 45%.[3] This made him the first governor of New Mexico to serve two successive four-year terms after term limits were expanded to two terms in 1991.[4] Johnson made the promotion of a school voucher system a "hallmark issue" of his second term.[5] Contents 1 Democratic Party 1.1 Candidates 1.2 Primary Results 2 Republican Party 2.1 Candidates 2.2 Primary Results 3 Campaign 4 Election results 5 References 6 See also Democratic Party[edit] Candidates[edit] Martin Chávez, Mayor of Albuquerque Gary K.
