Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee for President of the United States, chose Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia as her running mate.[1][2] The formal nomination took place at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. The Clinton-Kaine ticket lost the 2016 presidential election to the Republican Trump-Pence ticket, and Kaine returned to the Senate following the campaign. Contents 1 Selection process 2 Reported shortlist 3 Announcement 4 Other candidates 4.1 List released by WikiLeaks 4.2 Other speculated candidates 5 See also 6 References Selection process[edit] By April 2016, Clinton had begun discussions with advisers and allies regarding her potential running mate, though Bernie Sanders continued to challenge her in the Democratic primaries.[3] According to campaign sources, Clinton did not have a particular running mate in mind, and did not feel pressured to pick a running mate designed specifically to appeal to Sanders supporters.[3] There was relatively little public discussion about Sanders's running mate selection process.[4] As the 2016 Republican National Convention took place roughly one week before the July 25–28 Democratic National Convention, the Democratic presidential nominee was set to choose her running mate after the Republicans nominated their ticket of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.[3] Clinton's running mate selection process was led by campaign chairman John Podesta and Cheryl Mills,[3][5] while the vetting process was led by attorney James Hamilton.[6] In discussing her potential vice presidential choice, Clinton stated that the most important attribute she was looking for is the ability and experience to immediately step into the role of president.[7] In contrast to previous Democratic presidential nominees, Clinton allowed for a relatively open selection process, holding rallies with many potential running mates and placing little emphasis on keeping her short list confidential.[8] Reported shortlist[edit] The Wall Street Journal reported on June 16, 2016 that Clinton's shortlist included the following nine individuals.[9] Representative Xavier Becerra of California Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro of Texas Senator and former Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti of California Secretary of Labor Tom Perez of Maryland Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio According to a CNN report published on June 21, 2016, Clinton had narrowed down her list to no more than five contenders, including Kaine, Warren, and Castro.[10] However, a separate Washington Post report released that same day stated that, while Clinton had begun vetting Kaine, Warren, and Castro, more than a dozen people remained on her list of possible running mates.[11] On July 7, 2016, CNN reported that Clinton had narrowed down her shortlist to five people: Brown, Kaine, Perez, Warren, and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. On July 12, 2016, The New York Times confirmed that the Clinton campaign was vetting former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Retired Admiral James G. Stavridis.[12] Clinton also met with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper in mid-July, fueling speculation that he might be chosen as the vice presidential nominee.[7] After Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump named Mike Pence as his running mate on July 15, Kaine and Vilsack emerged as the top two contenders, although other individuals such as Perez remained in contention.[7] Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack[13] Retired Admiral and former NATO commander James Stavridis[12] Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado[14] Announcement[edit] On July 22, Clinton announced via Twitter that she had chosen Tim Kaine as her running mate.[2] After the selection, Amy Chozick of the New York Times described Kaine as a "battleground state politician with working-class roots and a fluency in Spanish."[15] Like his Republican counterpart, Mike Pence, Kaine has experience both as a governor and a member of Congress.[16] If the Clinton-Kaine ticket had won election, Kaine would have resigned from the Senate, with Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe appointing Kaine's replacement prior to a 2017 special election.[16][17] According to journalist Glenn Thrush, Kaine had been the preferred choice of Clinton since at least February 2016.[18] Other candidates[edit] List released by WikiLeaks[edit] On October 18, 2016 WikiLeaks released more hacked emails from Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta. One of these emails Podesta sent Clinton was a "first cut of people to consider for VP" in March 2016. He wrote that this list had been generated with other top aides. Podesta organized the list of 39 contenders into what he called "food groups" apparently based around identities — Latinos, women, African-Americans, military brass, and business leaders.[19] Representative Xavier Becerra of California Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro of Texas Mayor of Los Angeles Eric Garcetti of California Secretary of Labor Tom Perez of Maryland Former Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar of Colorado Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico Senator and former Governor Tim Kaine of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe of Virginia Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack of Iowa Mayor of Columbia Stephen Benjamin of South Carolina Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey Mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum of Florida Former Attorney General Eric Holder of New York Former Governor Deval Patrick of Massachusetts Mayor of Atlanta Kasim Reed of Georgia Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx of North Carolina Retired US Marine Corps four-star General John Allen Retired US Navy Admiral and chancellor of The University of Texas Bill McRaven Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen CEO of General Motors Mary Barra of Michigan Former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg of New York CEO of Xerox Ursula Burns of New York CEO of Apple Inc.
