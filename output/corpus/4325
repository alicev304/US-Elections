Having won the state eight years earlier against Barack Obama, Clinton managed a 26-point-routing against Bernie Sanders in 2016 despite the Sanders campaign's efforts in the state. She carried all counties in the Garden State but two, winning large victories in the cities of Newark, Trenton, and Atlantic City.
