Maine voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. On March 5 and 6, 2016, in the caucuses, voters expressed their preferences for the Republican, Democratic, and Green parties' respective nominees for president. Registered members of each party only voted in their party's caucus, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote. On election day, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton carried Maine's two at-large electoral votes with a plurality and won Maine's 1st congressional district while Republican nominee (and national election winner) Donald Trump won Maine's 2nd congressional district, making him the first Republican to do so since George H. W. Bush in 1988 and making him the first Republican to win an electoral vote from a New England state since George W. Bush won New Hampshire in 2000. Maine was once one of the most Republican states in the East. It voted Democratic only three times (1912, 1964 and 1968) from 1856 to 1988, but a Democrat has won the state's popular vote in every election since then. Although regarded as a safe blue state, Maine shifted dramatically and unexpectedly towards the Republicans, with Hillary Clinton's 2.9% margin of victory the narrowest for a Democrat since 1988, when Republicans last won the state, and well down on Obama's 15.3% margin just 4 years earlier. As a measure of how Republican Maine once was at the presidential level, Trump is only the second Republican to win the White House without winning the popular vote in Maine. George W. Bush lost the state in both of his campaigns. This was the first time since the 1828 presidential election of Democratic nominee Andrew Jackson that an electoral vote split occurred in Maine and the first time that a split occurred after Maine began awarding electoral votes based on congressional districts in 1972. This was also the first time that a state without the use of a faithless elector split its electoral college vote since 2008 in Nebraska.

The Maine Green Independent Party didn't compile the results until the state convention on May 7, during which it then assigned delegates based on the results.[2][3] On March 13, 2016, it was announced that Jill Stein had won the Maine Green Independent Party caucuses.[4] Maine Green Party presidential caucus, February 27 – March 19, 2016 Candidate Votes Percentage National delegates Jill Stein - - - William Kreml - - - Kent Mesplay - - - Sedinam Moyowasifza-Curry - - - Darryl Cherney - - - Uncommitted - - - Total - - - Libertarian convention[edit] The Libertarian Party nominated its ticket, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts Governor William Weld for vice president, at its national convention in Orlando, Florida, on May 29, 2016.[5] Until July 13, 2016, the Libertarian Party was not a legally recognized party in Maine. A 2013 change in the ballot access law permitted a party to gain recognition if they enroll 5,000 Maine voters in the party. The Libertarian Party of Maine turned approximately 6,500 signatures in to the Maine Secretary of State's office in 2015, but Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap invalidated 2,000 of them, bringing the total below the threshold required. The party then sued Dunlap, claiming Maine's ballot access requirements were unconstitutionally unreasonable. While losing an initial ruling by U.S. District Court Judge John Woodcock,[6] Woodcock later ordered that they be given until July 12 to collect the necessary signatures.[7] On July 13, Dunlap certified that 5,150 signatures had been validated, surpassing the threshold required to allow their candidates on the ballot. Maintenance of the status required obtaining 10,000 presidential votes in the general election.[8] General election[edit] Maine distributes 2 EVs based on the statewide vote and 1 EV for each congressional district's vote.
