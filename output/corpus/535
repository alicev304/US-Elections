He was tutored privately, and graduated from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1779. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1784 and commenced practice in Princeton. He was elected as a Federalist to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Frederick Frelinghuysen and served from November 12, 1796 to March 4, 1799, but declined to be a candidate for reelection. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of New Jersey in 1801, 1803, and 1804. He was elected as a Federalist to the Thirteenth Congress, serving from March 4, 1813, to March 3, 1815, and declined to be a candidate for renomination to the Fourteenth Congress. Stockton was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.[1] After leaving Congress, he resumed the practice of his profession. He died at Morven, near Princeton, and was interred in Princeton Cemetery in Princeton.

His son Commodore Robert F. Stockton was the Military Governor of California who defeated the Mexican army in 1846. He later became a senator from New Jersey like his father before him. His daughter Annie Stockton was the first wife of U.S. Senator John Renshaw Thomson. References[edit] ^ American Antiquarian Society Members Directory ^ a b Bill, Alfred Hoyt (1954).
