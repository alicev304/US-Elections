These elections formed part of the 2018 United States elections. Other coinciding elections were the 2018 United States Senate elections and the 2018 United States House of Representatives elections. The last regular gubernatorial elections for all but three of the states took place in 2014. Governors in New Hampshire and Vermont serve two-year terms, meaning that their most recent gubernatorial elections took place in 2016. Meanwhile, Oregon held a special election in 2016 to fill an unexpired term. Many of the states holding gubernatorial elections have term limits which made some multi-term governors ineligible for re-election. Two Democratic governors were term-limited while six incumbent Democratic governors were eligible for re-election. Among Republican governors, twelve were term-limited while eleven could seek re-election. One independent governor was eligible for re-election. Elections were held in 26 of the 33 states with Republican governors, 9 of the 16 states with Democratic governors, 1 state (Alaska) with an independent governor, 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) with Republican governors, 1 territory (U.S. Virgin Islands) with an independent governor and the District of Columbia with a Democratic mayor. Incumbent state governors running to be reelected included 14 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent. Territorial incumbents running included one Republican and one independent. The incumbent Democratic mayor of Washington, D.C. also ran for re-election. Democrats gained control of 9 state and territorial governorships that had previously been held by Republicans and an independent. They picked up Republican-held open seats in the states of Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Nevada and New Mexico, in addition to defeating Republican incumbents in Illinois and Wisconsin and not losing any seats of their own. Additionally, they won the Republican controlled territory of (Guam) and the independent controlled territory of the (U.S. Virgin Islands). Republicans won the governorship of Alaska previously held by an independent.[2] Democrats also won the total popular vote for the year's gubernatorial elections for the second year in a row. Like the 2016 presidential election, Republicans won a majority of governorships despite losing the popular vote by almost three million votes. Democrats won the popular vote nationally by 3.1 points, an improvement against the presidential popular vote margin in 2016.

California held a nonpartisan blanket primary to select nominees while the other 35 states held partisan primaries.[3] Nominations were contested except in Democratic primaries in Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Alaska and in Republican primaries in New Mexico, Iowa, Maryland, New Hampshire and New York.[3] Because the primary did not yield a candidate winning the state-required minimum share of the vote, runoff elections were held for Republican nominations in South Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma as well as for the Democratic nomination in Texas, four of the ten states with a runoff requirement.[4] In Georgia and Oklahoma, the runoff reversed the order of finish in the first primary. On average, there were 4.5 candidates per contested gubernatorial nomination and the average nominee received 61% of the vote cast.[3] The extent of competition varied widely across primaries, both within and across states. For the Republican nominations in Texas and Wisconsin and the Democratic nomination in Oregon, only the winner received 9% or more of the vote case—one-sided elections. However, the winner received less than one-half of the vote cast for Democratic nominations in Illinois Texas Maine Colorado Maryland Minnesota Wisconsin Vermont Arizona Florida and for Republican nominations in Idaho Oregon Pennsylvania Georgia South Carolina Colorado Oklahoma Tennessee Kansas Connecticut Wyoming Thus, most states had at least one highly contested gubernatorial nomination.[3] In California, twenty-seven listed candidates received primary votes, with the winners having 34% and 25% of the votes cast. Though Republicans re-elected more than twice as many incumbents (11:5) than did Democrats, the nominations were roughly equally competitive between parties.[3] The only incumbent to lose a primary election was a Republican in Kansas.[5] Renominated Republican governors lost general elections in Illinois and Wisconsin.[6] Election predictions[edit] Several sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use "tossup" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, "lean" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, "likely" or "favored" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage and "safe" or "solid" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a "tilt" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the "lean" rating would indicate (except Fox News, where "likely" is the highest rating given). Governors whose names are in parentheses are not contesting the election. State PVI Incumbent[7] Last race Cook October 26, 2018[8] I.E.
