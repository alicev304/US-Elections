===Eligibility requirements===
[[File:NaturalBornCitizenClause.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The hand-written copy of the [[natural-born-citizen clause]] as it appeared in 1787]]

[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two]] of the Constitution stipulates that for a person to serve as president, the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old, and a resident of the United States for a period of no less than 14 years. A candidate may start running his or her campaign early before turning 35 years old or completing 14 years of residency, but must meet the age and residency requirements by [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]]. The [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the Constitution also sets a [[term limit]]: a president cannot be elected to more than two terms.

The U.S. Constitution also has two provisions that apply to all federal offices in general, not just the presidency. [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]] states that if Congress convicts any officer on impeachment, they may also bar that person from holding any public office in the future. And [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]] prohibits the election to any federal office of any person who had held any federal or state office and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion or treason; this disqualification can be waived if such an individual gains the consent of two-thirds of both houses of Congress.

In addition, the Twelfth Amendment establishes that the vice-president must meet all the qualifications of being a president.

Although not a mandatory requirement, Federal campaign finance laws including the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] state that a candidate who intends to receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000, among others, must first file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]].<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.fec.gov/press/resources/2016presidential_form2nm.shtml | title=2016 Presidential Form 2 Filers | publisher=Federal Election Commission | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> This has led presidential candidates, especially members from the two major political parties, to officially announce their intentions to run as early as the spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising or spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.<ref name="WAPOST20150403">{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/04/03/why-hillary-clinton-might-have-just-two-more-weeks-or-so-to-announce-shes-running-for-president/ | title=Why Hillary Clinton might have just two more weeks or so to announce she's running for president | author=Jose A. DelReal | work=Washington Post | date=April 3, 2015 | accessdate=April 12, 2015}}</ref> Potential candidates usually form [[exploratory committee]]s even earlier to determining the feasibility of them actually running.

===Decentralized election system and voter eligibility===
{{see|Elections in the United States|Voting rights in the United States|Voter registration in the United States}}

The U.S. presidential election process, like all other [[elections in the United States]], is a highly decentralized system.<ref name="NCSL">{{cite web|title=Election Administration at State and Local Levels|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> While the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] does set parameters for the election of the president and other federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including the primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), and the specific details of running each state's electoral college meeting. All elections, including federal, are administered by the individual states.<ref name="whitehouse">{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/elections-and-voting |title=Elections & Voting |website=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>

Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government. Candidates must submit separate filings in each of the 50 states if they want to qualify on each state's ballot, and the requirements for filing vary by state.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/time-running-short-for-new-2020-democrats-to-jump-in-as-filing-deadlines-approach|title=Time running short for new 2020 Democrats to jump in as filing deadlines approach |newspaper=Washington Examiner |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>

The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th]] and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th]] Amendments to the Constitution state that [[suffrage]] cannot be denied on grounds of race or color, sex, or age for citizens eighteen years or older, respectively. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility and registration.<ref name="whitehouse"/> And the specific requirements for voter eligibility and registration also vary by state, e.g. some states ban convicted felons from voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|website=Learning.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Nominating process===
{{main|United States presidential primary|United States presidential nominating convention}}

[[File:RNC-interior-Palin-20080903.jpg|thumb|The floor of the [[2008 Republican National Convention]] at the [[Xcel Energy Center]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].]]

The modern nominating process of U.S. presidential elections consists of two major parts: a series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] held in each state, and the [[United States presidential nominating convention|presidential nominating conventions]] held by each [[political party]]. This process was never included in the Constitution, and thus evolved over time by the political parties to clear the field of candidates.

The [[primary election]]s are run by state and local governments, while the [[caucus]]es are organized directly by the political parties. Some states hold only primary elections, some hold only caucuses, and others use a combination of both. These primaries and caucuses are staggered generally between January and June before the federal election, with [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] traditionally holding the first presidential state caucus and primary, respectively.

Like the general election, presidential caucuses or primaries are indirect elections. The major political parties officially vote for their presidential candidate at their respective nominating conventions, usually all held in the summer before the federal election. Depending on each state's law and state's political party rules, when voters cast ballots for a candidate in a presidential caucus or primary, they may be voting to award delegates "bound" to vote for a candidate at the presidential nominating conventions, or they may simply be expressing an opinion that the state party is not bound to follow in selecting delegates to their respective national convention.

Unlike the general election, voters in the U.S. territories can also elect delegates to the national conventions. Furthermore, each political party can determine how many delegates to allocate to each state and territory. In 2012 for example, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party conventions each used two different formulas to allocate delegates. The Democrats-based theirs on two main factors: the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the previous three presidential elections, and the number of electoral votes each state had in the Electoral College.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates">{{cite web|url=https://thegreenpapers.com/P12/D-Alloc.phtml|title=Democratic Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> In contrast, the Republicans assigned to each state 10 delegates, plus three delegates per congressional district.<ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates">{{cite web|url=https://thegreenpapers.com/P12/R-Alloc.phtml|title=Republican Detailed Delegate Allocation – 2012|work=The Green Papers|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}</ref> Both parties then gave a fixed number of delegates to each territory, and finally bonus delegates to states and territories that passed certain criteria.<ref name="greenpapersDEMDelegates"/><ref name="greenpapersGOPDelegates"/>

Along with delegates chosen during primaries and caucuses, state and U.S. territory delegations to both the Democratic and Republican party conventions also include "unpledged" delegates who have a vote. For Republicans, they consist of the three top party officials from each state and territory. Democrats have a more expansive group of unpledged delegates called "[[superdelegate]]s", who are party leaders and elected officials.

Each party's presidential candidate also chooses a vice presidential nominee to run with him or her on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention.

If no single candidate has secured a majority of delegates (including both pledged and unpledged), then a "[[brokered convention]]" results. All pledged delegates are then "released" and are able to switch their allegiance to a different candidate. Thereafter, the nomination is decided through a process of alternating political [[horse trading]], and additional rounds of re-votes.<ref>{{cite news |first=Katie |last=Paul |work=Newsweek |date=2008-02-07 |title=Convention Wisdom |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/109264 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Convention Q & A |last=Eun Kyung Kim |work=Gannett News Service |publisher=Detroit Free Press |date=2008-02-10 |url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080210/NEWS15/802100609/1009/NEWS07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/108729 |title=A Ticking Clock |first=Eleanor |last=Clift |date=2008-02-06 |work=Newsweek }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080209/NEWS01/80209008/0/towns63 |title=Post-primary questions answered |date=2008-02-09 |first=Jeffrey |last=Gold |work=Associated Press |publisher=Courier-Post }}</ref>

The conventions have historically been held inside [[convention center]]s, but since the late 20th century both the Democratic and Republican parties have favored [[Arena|sports arenas]] and domed stadiums to accommodate the increasing attendance.

===The popular vote on Election Day===
[[File:Larsz - US election 08 (by-sa).jpg|left|thumb|A Texas voter about to mark a selection for president on a ballot, 2008 Election Day]]

Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature. Although each state designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed. For instance, instead of having a popular vote, a number of states used to select presidential electors by a direct vote of the state legislature itself.

However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November," i.e., a Tuesday no earlier than November{{nbsp}}2 and no later than November{{nbsp}}8.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sandy unlikely to postpone election|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2012/10/30/sandy-obama-romney-election/1668501/|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> Today, the states and the District of Columbia each conduct their own popular elections on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] to help determine their respective slate of electors.

Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for the electors of a candidate" meaning the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate.

Many voting ballots allow a voter to "blanket vote" for all candidates in a particular [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]] or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as [[Ballot access in the United States|ballot access]]. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for president, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided enough voters have endorsed that candidate, usually through a signature list.

The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a [[write-in candidate]]. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as [[Mickey Mouse]] or comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.

Because U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for president. [[Guam]] has held [[straw poll]]s for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.<ref name="guammove">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/07/10/guam-legislature-moves-general-election-presidential-vote-to-the-september-primary/ |title=Guam Legislature Moves General Election Presidential Vote to the September Primary |publisher=Ballot-Access.org |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>

===Electoral college===
{{main|Electoral College (United States)}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege2016.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Electoral College map showing results of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 U.S. presidential election]]. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Donald Trump]] won the popular vote in 30 states (red) and in [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] to capture 306 electoral votes. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hillary Clinton]] won the popular vote in 20 states (blue) plus D.C. to capture 232 electoral votes. Of these, seven were cast by [[Faithless electors in the 2016 United States presidential election|faithless electors]]—two pledged to Trump and five pledged to Clinton—for other persons.]]

Most state laws establish a winner-take-all system, wherein the ticket that wins a [[Plurality voting|plurality]] of votes wins all of that state's allocated electoral votes, and thus has their slate of electors chosen to vote in the Electoral College. [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] do not use this method, instead giving two electoral votes to the statewide winner and one electoral vote to the winner of each Congressional district.

Each state's winning slate of electors then meets at their respective state's capital on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December to cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president. Although Electoral College members can vote for anyone under the U.S. Constitution, 32 [[U.S. state|states]] plus the [[District of Columbia]] have laws against [[faithless elector]]s,<ref>{{cite web |title=Faithless Elector State Laws |url=https://www.fairvote.org/faithless_elector_state_laws |website=Fair Vote |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Laws Binding Electors |url=http://presidentialelectorlaws.us |accessdate=4 March 2020}}</ref> those electors who do not cast their electoral votes for the person for whom they have pledged to vote. Two [[Faithless_elector#U.S._Supreme_Court|cases]] questioning the constitutionality of these laws are currently pending before the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].

In early January, the total Electoral College vote count is opened by the sitting vice president, acting in his capacity as [[President of the Senate#United States|President of the Senate]], and read aloud to a [[joint session of the United States Congress|joint session]] of the incoming Congress, which was elected at the same time as the President.

If no candidate receives a majority of the electoral vote (at least 270), the President is determined by the rules outlined by the Twelfth Amendment. Specifically, the selection of President would then be decided by a [[contingent election]] in a ballot of the House of Representatives. For the purposes of electing the President, each state has only one vote. A ballot of the Senate is held to choose the Vice President. In this ballot, each senator has one vote. The House has chosen the victor of the presidential race only twice, in [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]] and [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; the Senate has chosen the victor of the vice-presidential race only once, in [[1836 United States presidential election|1836]].

If the president is not chosen by Inauguration Day, the vice president-elect acts as president. If neither are chosen by then, Congress by law determines who shall act as president, pursuant to the Twentieth Amendment.

Unless there are faithless electors, disputes, or other controversies, the events in December and January mentioned above are largely a formality since the winner can be determined based on the state-by-state popular vote results. Between the general election and Inauguration Day, this apparent winner is referred to as the "[[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]]" (unless it is a sitting president who has won re-election).
