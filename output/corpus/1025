List of governors of Alaska From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Alaska) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Alaska The Seal of the State of Alaska Incumbent Mike Dunleavy since December 3, 2018 Residence Alaska Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, renewable once Inaugural holder William A. Egan Formation January 3, 1959 Deputy Kevin Meyer Salary $145,000 [1] Website gov.alaska.gov The governor of Alaska is the chief executive of the U.S. state of Alaska. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Alaska's state government and is charged with enforcing state laws. Eleven people have served as governor of the State of Alaska over 13 distinct terms, though Alaska had over 30 civilian and military governors during its long history as a United States territory. Only two governors, William A. Egan and Bill Walker, were born in Alaska. Two people, Egan and Wally Hickel, have been elected to multiple non-consecutive terms as governor. Hickel is also noted for a rare third party win in American politics, having been elected to a term in 1990 representing the Alaskan Independence Party. The longest-serving governor of the state was Egan, who was elected three times and served nearly 12 years. The longest-serving territorial governor was Ernest Gruening, who served 13½ years. The current governor is Republican Mike Dunleavy, who took office on December 3, 2018.

Before then, it was known as Russian America or Russian Alaska, controlled by the governors and general managers of the Russian-American Company. Commanders of the Department of Alaska[edit] The vast region was initially designated the Department of Alaska, under the jurisdiction of the Department of War and administered by the U.S. Army officers until 1877, when the Army was withdrawn from Alaska. The Department of the Treasury then took control, with the Collector of Customs as the highest ranking federal official in the territory. In 1879, the U.S. Navy was given jurisdiction over the department.[3] Some believe the first American administrator of Alaska was Polish immigrant Włodzimierz Krzyżanowski. However, the Anchorage Daily News was unable to find any conclusive information to support this claim.[4] Chief federal officers of the Department of Alaska No. Commander Position Term in office 1 Jefferson C.

The state constitution provides for the election of a governor and lieutenant governor every four years on the same ticket, with their terms commencing on the first Monday in the December following the election.[11] Governors are allowed to succeed themselves once, having to wait four years after their second term in a row before being allowed to run again.[12] Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor.[13] The original constitution of 1956 created the office of secretary of state, which was functionally identical to a lieutenant governor, and was renamed to "lieutenant governor" in 1970.[14] Governors of the State of Alaska[g] No. Governor Term in office Party Election Lt.
