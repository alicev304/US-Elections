West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming What You Can Do Experts’ understanding of how the virus spreads is still limited, but there are four factors that most likely play a role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face. If your community is affected, you can help reduce your risk and do your part to protect others by following some basic steps: Wash your hands! Scrub with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and then dry them with a clean towel or let them air dry. Keep distance from sick people. Try to stay six feet away from anybody showing flu- or cold-like symptoms, and don’t go to work if you’re sick. Prepare your family, and communicate your plan about evacuations, resources and supplies. Experts suggest stocking at least a 30-day supply of any needed prescriptions. Consider doing the same for food staples, laundry detergent and diapers, if you have small children. Here’s a complete guide on how you can prepare for the coronavirus outbreak.
