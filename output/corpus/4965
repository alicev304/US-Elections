The 2016 United States presidential election in Georgia was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the 2016 general election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Georgia voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting Republican Party nominee Donald Trump against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton. On March 1, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Georgia voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic and Republican respective presidential nominees for president. Trump won the Georgia Republican primary by a wide margin, and Clinton captured an easy victory in the Georgia Democratic primary. The Green Party presidential primary happened on June 4. In the general election, Republican nominee Donald Trump won Georgia by 5.1%, a lower margin compared to Mitt Romney's 7.82% in 2012, but also from John McCain's 5.20% in 2008. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton received 45.35% of the vote, making this a state where she performed slightly worse than Barack Obama's 45.83% in 2012.[1] Nevertheless, Trump's reduced margin of victory also made Georgia one of eleven states (plus the District of Columbia) to vote more Democratic in 2016 than in 2012.[2] The Atlanta metropolitan area shifted strongly Democratic compared to the previous presidential election, with Hillary Clinton being the first Democrat to win Henry County since 1980, and the first Democrat to win Gwinnett County and Cobb County since 1976, when Georgia native Jimmy Carter won all of the state's counties. The state of Georgia has been won by the Republican nominee in every election since 1996.

Defeating the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, with 52.9% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote,[3][4] Obama succeeded two-term Republican President George W. Bush, the former Governor of Texas. Obama and Biden were reelected in the 2012 presidential election, defeating former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney with 51.1% of the popular vote and 61.7% of electoral votes.[5] Although Barack Obama's approval rating in the RealClearPolitics poll tracking average remained between 40 and 50% for most of his second term, it has experienced a surge in early 2016 and reached its highest point since 2012 during June of that year.[6][7] Analyst Nate Cohn has noted that a strong approval rating for Barack Obama would equate to a strong performance for the Democratic candidate, and vice versa.[8] Following his second term, President Obama was not eligible for another reelection. In October 2015, Obama's running-mate and two-term Vice President Biden decided not to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination either.[9] With Obama and Biden's terms expiring on January 20, 2017, the electorate was asked to elect a new president, the 45th president and 48th vice president of the United States, respectively.
