The 2016 United States presidential election in Vermont was held on November 8, 2016, as part of the 2016 United States presidential election in which all 50 states plus the District of Columbia participated. Vermont voters chose three electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders received unsolicited write-in votes. Hillary Clinton easily won Vermont, regarded as one of the most progressive states in the country, with 55.7% of the vote,[1] a vote margin of 25.9% compared with the President Barack Obama's 35.6% vote margin in 2012.[2] Donald Trump received 29.8% of the vote and won only Essex County–the most rural and sparsely populated county in the state. He was the first Republican presidential candidate to win a county in Vermont since George W. Bush in 2004. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders received 5.7% of the vote through write-ins, the highest write-in draft campaign percentage for a statewide presidential candidate in history.[3] Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, received 3.1%, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein received 2.1%.[4] Contents 1 Primary elections 1.1 Democratic primary 1.1.1 Results 1.2 Republican primary 2 General election 2.1 Polling 2.2 Results 3 Results by County 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Primary elections[edit] On March 1, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Vermont voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Libertarian parties. Voters who were unaffiliated chose any 1 primary in which to vote. Democratic primary[edit] Main article: 2016 Vermont Democratic primary The 2016 Vermont Democratic primary took place on March 1 as one of the Democratic Party's primaries ahead of the 2016 presidential election. On the same day, dubbed "Super Tuesday," Democratic primaries were held in 10 other states plus American Samoa, while the Republican Party held primaries in 11 states including their own Vermont primary. As Sanders was an extremely popular favorite son, there was no campaign to speak of and all pledged delegates were given to Sanders, due to Clinton getting less than 15% of the popular vote.
