Clinton won the Florida Primary by 31 points, winning older voters by a margin of 71-26, and non-white voters by a margin of 74-25. Specifically, she won Hispanic/Latino voters by a margin of 68-32 (who made up 20% of the electorate), and African American voters 81-18 (who comprised 27% of the electorate). Clinton also won white voters by a narrower margin of 53-43. She won across all income and educational attainment levels.[40] In terms of religious affiliation, Clinton won Protestants in Florida 69-29 (36% of the electorate), Catholics 69-29 (22% of the electorate), and other religious affiliations 68-31 (Jews were 4% of the electorate but were unaccounted for in exit polls). Sanders won voters who identified as agnostic/atheist 56-31. In terms of political ideology, Clinton won liberals 59-41 and moderates/conservatives 70-26. And while Clinton won Democrats 71-28, Sanders won self-identified Independents 55-41.[41] Clinton won in Miami and along the Gold Coast 73-26, where there is a larger population of Hispanic/Latino voters who in South Florida are predominantly of Cuban or Nicaraguan descent. Clinton also won the Gulf Coast and Mid-Florida 64-35, the Tampa Bay Area 63-37, the Orlando area 62-34, and the Northern Panhandle which is whiter, more conservative and more rural by a smaller margin of 58-37.[42] References[edit] ^ Florida Division of Elections - Official Primary Results Archived 2016-03-16 at the Wayback Machine ^ "ARG Florida Poll March 11-13, 2016". ^ "March 14, 2016 - Trump Tops Rubio In Florida, Ties Kasich In Ohio, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Clinton Leads Sanders In Two Critical Primaries". ^ "Midwestern States a Toss Up Tuesday" (PDF). ^ "Poll: Trump and Kasich neck-and-neck in Ohio; Trump leads in Florida". ^ "Poll: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz split anti-Donald Trump vote in Florida". ^ "Polls: Trump Ahead in Florida, Illinois; Kasich Leads in Ohio". ^ "Poll: Rubio closing in on Trump in Florida". ^ "WOMEN DRIVE CLINTON TO 2-1 LEAD AMONG FLORIDA DEMS, QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY POLL FINDS; SHE HAS 9-POINT LEAD IN OHIO" (PDF). ^ "Exclusive Florida Decides Poll: Trump, Clinton lead Florida's presidential primaries". ^ "CNN/ORC Poll: Trump, Clinton leading in Florida, Ohio". ^ "Washington Post-Univision News Florida Democratic primary survey March 2016".
