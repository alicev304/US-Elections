Incumbent Democratic Governor Deval Patrick was re-elected to a second term.[3] Party primaries were held on September 14, though all four candidates ran unopposed in their respective primaries.[4] Tim Murray, who ran on a ticket with Patrick, was re-elected Lieutenant Governor. As of 2019, this is the most recent election in which a Democrat was elected Governor of Massachusetts.

Purcell, surgery clerk and ergonomics assessor[20] General election[edit] Defection of Loscocco[edit] On October 1, 2010, Loscocco announced that he would withdraw from the race and endorse Republican candidate Charlie Baker.[2] Loscocco formally remained on the ballot, however.[21] On October 7, Cahill filed a lawsuit against four former campaign aides, alleging that they conspired to undermine his candidacy and help Charlie Baker by arranging his defection.[22] Cahill claimed that e-mails between Republican political consultants and Loscocco's top aide suggested that Loscocco may have been enticed to leave the ticket by future job promises.[23] In response, Loscocco claimed that Cahill's top aide was coordinating strategy with the Patrick campaign and the Democratic Governors' Association and thus was never actually an independent effort.[24] Lottery ad[edit] Main article: Tim Cahill corruption trial Soon after Cahill filed suit against him, Adam Meldrum, Cahill's former campaign manager, alleged that Cahill colluded with the Massachusetts Lottery, which is overseen by the state treasurer's office, to run an ad favorable to him during the campaign. The ad, paid for by the Commonwealth, described the Massachusetts Lottery "the most successful state lottery America" and "consistently well-managed", echoing themes from Cahill's gubernatorial campaign. Both Cahill and Massachusetts Lottery Director Mark Cavanagh denied the allegations.[22] On October 18, e-mails released in conjunction with Cahill's lawsuit appeared to reveal that the campaign attempted to have the Lottery air a series of ads that praised the lottery's management. In the e-mails, Cahill's campaign media strategist Dane Strother told Meldrum to "Get the Lottery immediately cutting a spot and get it up...Needs to focus on the Lottery being the best in the country and above reproach." Two days later, Cahill's senior adviser Scott Campbell wrote, "I think the first thing is to figure out what/where/how we want to do this ... with Lottery people."[25] On April 2, 2012, Cahill was indicted by a Grand Jury on charges that he used $1.65 million in Massachusetts State Lottery advertising to aid his campaign for governor.[26] On December 12, 2012, a mistrial was declared in the corruption case after the jury failed to reach a verdict on two counts of conspiracy.[27] Polling[edit] Poll Date Deval Patrick (D) Charlie Baker (R) Tim Cahill (I) Jill Stein (GR) Rasmussen Reports June 24, 2009 41% 36% – – The Boston Globe/UNH July 15–21, 2009 30% 20% 30% – 35% 41% – – Rasmussen Reports October 22, 2009 34% 24% 23% – Suffolk University November 4–8, 2009 38% 15% 26% – Rasmussen Reports November 23, 2009 33% 28% 25% – The Boston Globe/UNH January 2–6, 2010 30% 19% 23% – Public Policy Polling January 7–9, 2010 29% 27% 21% – Suffolk University February 21–24, 2010 33% 25% 23% 3% Rasmussen Reports March 8, 2010 35% 32% 19% – Rasmussen Reports April 5, 2010 35% 27% 23% – April 17 – Baker secures Republican nomination at convention; Mihos eliminated Rasmussen Reports May 10, 2010 45% 31% 14% 1% Suffolk University May 25, 2010 42% 29% 14% 8% Rasmussen Reports June 21, 2010 41% 34% 16% – The Boston Globe/UNH June 17–23, 2010 38% 31% 9% 2% Rasmussen Reports July 22, 2010 38% 32% 17% – Statehouse News August 29–31, 2010 34% 28% 18% 4% Rasmussen Reports September 1, 2010 39% 34% 18% – Rasmussen Reports September 17, 2010 45% 42% 5% – Suffolk University / 7 News September 16–19, 2010 41% 34% 14% 4% The Boston Globe/UNH September 17–22, 2010 35% 34% 11% 4% Western New England College[permanent dead link] September 19–23, 2010 39% 33% 16% 3% Rasmussen Reports September 30, 2010 47% 42% 6% – Suffolk University 7 News October 10–12, 2010 46% 39% 10% 1% Public Opinion Strategies October 11–13, 2010 35% 42% 10% 2% Rasmussen Reports October 18, 2010 47% 42% 6% – Western New England College October 22, 2010 44% 36% 8% 5% Boston Globe October 24, 2010 43% 39% 8% 2% Suffolk University/7News October 25–27, 2010 46% 39% 9% 2% Rasmussen Reports October 27, 2010 46% 44% 6% — Western New England College October 24–28, 2010 42% 37% 11% 3% Results (for comparison) [November 2, 2010] [ 48.4% ] [ 42.0% ] [ 8.0% ] [ 1.4% ] Hypothetical polling with Christy Mihos Poll source Dates administered Deval Patrick Christy Mihos Jill Stein Tim Cahill Rasmussen Reports June 24, 2009 40% 41% –– –– The Boston Globe/UNH July 15–21, 2009 31% 18% –– 31% 40% 41% –– –– Rasmussen Reports August 20, 2009 35% 40% –– –– Rasmussen Reports October 22, 2009 34% 23% –– 23% Suffolk University November 4–8, 2009 36% 20% –– 26% Rasmussen Reports November 23, 2009 32% 26% –– 28% The Boston Globe/UNH January 2–6, 2010 32% 19% –– 23% Public Policy Polling January 7–9, 2010 28% 21% –– 25% Suffolk University February 21–24, 2010 34% 19% 3% 26% Rasmussen Reports March 8, 2010 34% 19% –– 30% Rasmussen Reports April 5, 2010 38% 15% –– 33% with Grace Ross Poll source Dates administered Grace Ross Charlie Baker Tim Cahill Rasmussen Reports May 10, 2010 27% 32% 16% Fundraising[edit] As of October 31, 2010.[28] Shading indicates candidate with the highest amount.
