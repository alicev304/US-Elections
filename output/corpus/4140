In his office is a portrait of himself that was based on one of Donald Trump. Co-writer Bob Gale says that the Trump connection was definitely intentional.[47] In a 1990 episode of Growing Pains, Donald Trump hand delivers a large donation off camera while the Seaver family is showering and getting ready to host a charity clinic fundraiser. It is mentioned several times that he may attend in order to get the family members to hurry the preparations.

Trump's then (as of the setting of the film) wife Ivana Trump is also mentioned in a different scene. In the 2004 film Million Dollar Baby, there is an advertisement on the side of a bus for The Apprentice TV show with a photo of Donald Trump on it. In Friends Season 4, episode 11 - "The One with Phoebe's Uterus", Joey walks in wearing a blue blazer to which Chandler gets tongue-tied while delivering his joke: “I don’t know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.” In Friends Season 5, episode 5 - "The One with the Kips", Chandler tells Joey he saw Donald Trump waiting for an elevator during his business trip. Joey later finds out that Monica also saw Donald Trump waiting for an elevator during her business trip. This leads Joey to conclude that Monica and Chandler actually spent the weekend together. In American Dad S1 E2, after Stan Smith says "you're fired!", Donald Trump shows up and Stan reacts saying "Oh for God's sake, somebody pay Mr Trump!".
