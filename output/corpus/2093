0843 cnna people around world rethink many aspect life combat coronavirus pandemic nasa expert say knowledge understanding stay safe healthy will help prepare landing another planet nasa robotic explorer already mars pave way future astronautled mission red planet expedition will require level safety planning put germophobe shame astronaut want carry earth bacterium surface mars contaminate environment even show false positive life planet also careful quarantine sample require level care caution exercise daily life now eye mars curiosity see red planet apollo program astronaut quarantine moon landing week case encounter pathogen lunar surface sample moon treat level care biohazard read now know astronaut pick disease moon walk life know moon surface hit micrometeorite radiation atmosphere protect smart move human explore unknown want protect astronaut mars 2020 rover officially name perseverance also part reason cospar global committee space research exist form 1958 research exploration peaceful use outer space international cooperation accord cospar mission statement cospar planetary protection policy pdf ensure world space agency protect safety planet well explore planetary protection requirement international nato treaty ratify cospar moogega stricker planetary protection lead engineer nasa perseverance rover mission tell cnn june international policy abide agencies around world make sure hardware spacecraft clean enough life exist warm wet mars ancient earth crater may explain govern level sterilization spacecraft robotic explorer endure launch rover lander assemble nasa cleanroom people allow enter cover headtotoe white coverall call bunny suit complete face shield even precaution will take human send explore mars nasa prepare safe exploration sample mars nasas next generation martian rover name perseverance will land mars jezero crater next year site lake exist 35 billion year ago perseverance will collect sample seal preserve earth hopefully sometime 2020s stricker job make sure contaminate mars earth germ go explore planet lab team take sample collect spacecraft grow petri dish see clean spacecraft really launch look evidence spore attach spacecraft look seed certain microbe produce thing survive journey deep space harsh environment look petri dish every single day swab spacecraft stricker say marsquakes nasa mission discover mars seismically active among surprise also look viable organism like e coli live skin although something like survive without host find martian surface confuse fossilized life stricker say room rover construct cleaner operating room cleaner lot thing interact say parts spacecraft will actually touch martian surface sterilize fire 662 degree fahrenheit just cleanest thing ever go see stricker say include collection tube sample mars perseverance will collect rock mineral soil sample soil sample even include microfossil ancient organism may live lake datum collect may able help scientist know find biosignature mars nasa want bring martian sample back earth need someone lead mission science side really think new discovery make surface will inform learn get sample back say katie stack morgan deputy project scientist rover nasas jet propulsion laboratory pasadena california also speak cnn june job find best sample collect store place surface rover will pick sample put inside body seal tight metal tube design withstand martian environment least hope nasa engineer sample will drop specific collection site retrieve later combine understanding composition rock also fine detail see rock texture make powerful case ancient sign life stack morgan say know ancient mars habitable yet able show sign real sign ancient life yet instrument suite think make real advance towards surface meteorites reveal martian water come different source sample challenge road nasa already plan earliest mission go back mars retrieve sample set 20262027 timeframe stack morgan say huge endeavor human species itll take cooperation just space program stack morgan say resource develop technology get buyin international partner space administration government really make happen mars 2020 rover will search fossil sign ancient life new rover will also mission lay groundwork future human exploration much think mars inhabit human come mars make use resource martian environment today say stack morgan send robotic scout first learn place hopefully prepare way go four way mars 2020 rover will pave way manned mission sample also inform land human mars martian sample earth search evidence life will send biosafety level 4 laboratory use research pathogen cause fatal disease like coronavirus say jim green nasas chief scientist life ancient exist find mars study sample discovery will cause cospar member change cospar guideline come way explore mars green say water find inch beneath martian surface help future astronaut frankly change everything mean possibility now endless potential civilization even microbial population stricker say intelligent complex microbe actually quite intelligent complex admire find sign life will shift idea alone stand universe human mars conversation week host nonprofit organization explore mars inc green penelope boston director nasas astrobiology institute consider human safely explore mars greens idea mars mission include landing one spot separately live another set exploration zone allow astronaut work confine area mars perform scientific experiment suggest future mission land live spot create first mission 12000 people want part nasas next class astronaut give wonderful opportunity several decade go build develop thing site say green gain deep understanding mars far robotic exploration reveal similarity soil earth mars strong human exploration experiment reveal even astronauts moon mars may grow home mushroom say nasa life find mars bostons research lead believe will deep beneath surface recent study show life exist rock crack earths ocean floor martian subsurface care will need take potential subsurface groundwater source mars contaminate human exploration id love see boot mars aware deep ecology aspect another biosphere boston say study cohabit without damage luckily surface environment harsh entirely selfsterilize will lot reduce contaminant stricker job will evolve human land mars shell need develop stringent safety rule unlike one implement today well live mars make sure people live example crop stay intact say lot thing bring along need contaminate weird bug compare fly one country another
