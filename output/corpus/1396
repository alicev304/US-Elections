The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War. New Jersey’s electoral vote was split, with four of the electors pledged to Lincoln being elected because the alternative, a fusion ticket of electors supporting other candidates, saw the Breckinridge and Bell electors finish behind all other candidates.[4] and three Douglas electors being elected.[4] Year Winner (nationally) Votes Percent Loser (nationally) Votes Percent Loser (nationally) Votes Percent Loser (nationally) Votes Percent Electoral Votes 1860 Abraham Lincoln 58,346 48.1 Stephen A.

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain.

To the extent that a popular vote was held, it was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.
