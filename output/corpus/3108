The order goes into effect at 8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25. It will remain in effect until May 15 or until the public health threat is eliminated. “Delawareans have a basic, fundamental right to vote. Today’s order will preserve that right and allow Delawareans to vote by absentee ballot in the presidential primary on June 2,” said Governor Carney. “The additional protections in this order are essential to help support Delawareans – especially our most vulnerable neighbors – as this situation evolves. This is an extremely challenging economic situation for many of our neighbors, and we need to do what we can to support them.” Governor Carney’s order prevents landlords from evicting Delawareans from their homes during this crisis. Landlords also may not charge late fees or interest during the State of Emergency. The order also prevents lenders from commencing foreclosures during this period. Residential mortgage foreclosures that began prior to Governor Carney’s State of Emergency declaration will not move forward until the 31st day following the termination of the Governor’s emergency declaration, at the earliest. Governor Carney’s order also prevents residential utility service companies from terminating service or charging fees for late-payments for services. Additionally, all elections for school board members in any Delaware school district scheduled for May 12 are delayed until June 16 under Governor Carney’s updated order on Tuesday. The order also states that social distancing due to COVID-19 is a valid reason to vote by absentee ballot. Additional details about local elections, school district referendums, evictions, foreclosures, and utilities are available in the text of the order. Delawareans with general questions about COVID-19 or their exposure risk can call the Division of Public Health’s Coronavirus Call Center at 1-866-408-1899, or 711 for individuals who are hearing-impaired, from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Questions can also be submitted by email atDPHCall@delaware.gov. DPH will continue to update the public as more information becomes available.
