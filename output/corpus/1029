Governor of Colorado From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Governor of Colorado Seal of the Executive Office Incumbent Jared Polis since January 8, 2019 Style The Honorable Residence Colorado Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, renewable once consecutively Inaugural holder John Long Routt Formation August 1, 1876 Deputy Dianne Primavera Salary $123,193 (2019)[1] Website www.colorado.gov/governor The Governor of Colorado is the chief executive of the U.S. state of Colorado. The governor is the head of the executive branch of Colorado's state government and is charged with enforcing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Colorado General Assembly, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason or impeachment.[2] The governor is also the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces. Seven people served as governor of Colorado Territory over eight terms, appointed by the President of the United States. Since statehood, there have been 36 governors, serving 41 distinct terms. The longest-serving governors were Richard "Dick" Lamm (1975-1987) and Roy Romer (1987-1999), who each served 12 years over three terms. The shortest term occurred in March 16 and 17, 1905, when the state had three governors in the span of 24 hours: Alva Adams won the election, but soon after he took office, the legislature declared his opponent, James Hamilton Peabody, governor, but on the condition that he immediately resign, so that his lieutenant governor, Jesse McDonald, could be governor. Thus, Peabody served less than a day as governor. The current governor is Democrat Jared Polis, who took office on January 8, 2019.

The Jefferson Territory had only one governor, Robert Williamson Steele, a pro-union Democrat elected by popular vote. He proclaimed the territory dissolved on June 6, 1861, several months after the official formation of the Colorado Territory, but only days after the arrival of its first governor.[5] Governors of the Territory of Colorado[edit] The Territory of Colorado was organized on February 28, 1861, from parts of the territories of New Mexico, Utah, and Nebraska, and the unorganized territory that was previously the western portion of Kansas Territory.[6] Governors of the Territory of Colorado No. Governor Term in office Appointed by 1 William Gilpin March 25, 1861[7][a] – March 26, 1862[b] Abraham Lincoln 2 John Evans March 26, 1862[7] – October 17, 1865[c] 3 Alexander Cummings October 17, 1865[11] – April 24, 1867 Andrew Johnson 4 Alexander Cameron Hunt April 24, 1867[11] – June 14, 1869 5 Edward M.

McCook June 19, 1874[12] – March 29, 1875 8 John Long Routt March 29, 1875[14] – November 3, 1876[f] Governors of the State of Colorado[edit] The State of Colorado was admitted to the Union on August 1, 1876. To serve as governor, one must be at least 30 years old, be a citizen of the United States, and have been a resident of the state for at least two years prior to election. The state constitution of 1876 originally called for election of the governor every two years, with their term beginning on the second Tuesday of the January following the election.[15] An amendment passed in 1956, taking effect in 1959, increased terms to four years.[16] Originally, there was no term limit applied to the governor; a 1990 amendment allowed governors to succeed themselves only once.[17] There is however no limit on the total number of terms one may serve as long as one who has served the two term limit is out of office for four years. Should the office of governor become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.[18] If both the offices governor and lieutenant governor are vacant, the line of succession moves down through the senior members of the state senate and state house of representatives of the same party as the governor.[19] The lieutenant governor was elected separately from the governor until a 1968 amendment to the constitution[20] made it so that they are elected on the same ticket.[21] Governors of the State of Colorado[g] No. Governor Term in office Party Election Lt.

Gilpin himself did not arrive in the territory until May 27, 1861.[8] ^ Gilpin was removed from office for improper financial drafts from the federal treasury.[9] ^ Evans resigned at the request of President Johnson following the Sand Creek Massacre. The resignation was requested on July 18, 1865.[10] ^ McCook was removed from office by petition.[12] ^ Records show Elbert served "less than a year", but his successor was appointed on June 19, 1874, which was 14 months after Elbert took office.[13] ^ a b The state was admitted on August 1, but Routt was formally inaugurated as state governor on November 3.[22] ^ Data is sourced from the National Governors Association, unless supplemental references are required. ^ Lieutenant governors represented the same party as their governor unless noted. ^ a b c d e f Represented the Republican Party ^ Represented the Populist Party ^ The Colorado State Archives labels Coates a Democrat;[23] however, a contemporary New York Times article describes him as a Populist elected on a fusion ticket, and that he had renounced all other parties and become a Socialist.[24] ^ a b c d e The 1904 election was rife with fraud and controversy. Alva Adams won election, but soon after he took office the Republican legislature declared James Peabody to be the actual winner, on the condition that Peabody immediately tender his resignation, postdated to the next day. Peabody's lieutenant governor, Jesse McDonald, then succeeded to the governorship.[25] ^ The Colorado State Archives says Haggott served from 1902 to 1903; however, multiple sources say he served with Peabody[26] well into 1904,[27] so it is assumed the Archives are in error. ^ a b c Represented the Democratic Party ^ Johnson resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[28] ^ Carr instead unsuccessfully ran for United States Senate.[29] ^ Knous resigned to take a seat on the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.[30] ^ First term under a 1956 constitutional amendment, which lengthened terms to four years.[16] ^ Love resigned to be Director of the Office of Energy Policy.[31] ^ Polis' first term expires on January 10, 2023.
