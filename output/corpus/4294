American voters (70-30), women (55-45), and older voters (63-36), especially senior citizens (70-29). This margin was narrower than might have been expected, with Bernie Sanders winning with voters under the age of 45 (70%-30%) who made up 39% of the electorate and white voters (57-42) who made up 58% of the electorate. He also won men, 53-45. According to exit polls, the Hispanic/Latino vote was split, with Sanders narrowly winning 50-49. As became a trend in the Democratic primary race, Hillary Clinton won Democrats (57-42), but Sanders won self-identified Independents (69-30). Clinton performed well in Chicago where the electorate is more diverse (she won 54-46) and in the Cook Suburbs (she won 53-46). Sanders performed well in the Collar Counties (he won 52-47) in the north (he won 53-46) and in the central/south part of the state which is whiter and more rural (he won 54-45).[12] References[edit] ^ "ANALYSIS: 2016 Illinois Democratic Primary" (PDF). ^ "Midwestern States a Toss Up Tuesday" (PDF). ^ "Poll: Trump and Kasich neck-and-neck in Ohio; Trump leads in Florida". ^ "Polls: Trump Ahead in Florida, Illinois; Kasich Leads in Ohio". ^ "Illinois Democratic Presidential Primary March 8". ^ "Clinton holds commanding lead over Sanders in Illinois".
