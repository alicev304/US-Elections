Instead, the vast majority of these elections are held at the county and municipal level. On the ballot are many mayors, a wide variety of citizen initiatives in various states, and many more local public offices. They may also feature a number of special elections to fill vacancies in various federal, state and local offices. Because such off-year elections feature far fewer races than either presidential or midterm elections, they generate far lower voter turnout than even-numbered election years.[4][5] Contents 1 Federal elections 2 State elections 3 Local elections 4 Comparison with other U.S. General Elections 5 See also 6 References Federal elections[edit] Regularly scheduled elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives are always held in even-numbered years. Elections for these offices are only held during odd-numbered years if accommodating a special election—usually either due to incumbents resigning or dying while in office. Special elections are never held for the U.S. President. If the President dies, resigns or is (via impeachment conviction) removed from office, the successor is determined by the presidential line of succession, as specified by the United States Constitution and the Presidential Succession Act, and serves the rest of the presidential term. State elections[edit] Five states elect their respective governors to four-year terms during off-year elections: Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and Virginia.[6] Kentucky, Louisiana, and Mississippi hold their gubernatorial elections during the off-year before the presidential election, i.e. in years leaving remainder 3 when divided by 4; e.g. the 2015 elections. New Jersey and Virginia then hold theirs in the off-year after the presidential election, i.e. in years leaving remainder 1 when divided by 4; e.g. the 2017 elections. Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, and Virginia also hold off-year state legislative elections. Off-years may also feature a wide variety of citizen initiatives in various states, as well as a number of special elections to fill various state offices. States may also allow recall elections, such as the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election, when California voters replaced then Governor Gray Davis with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Local elections[edit] A majority of races held during off-year, odd-numbered election years are those for offices at the municipal and local level. Many cities across the country may elect their mayors and other local officials during off-years. However, as a matter of convenience and cost saving, many other city and local governments may instead hold their elections during even-numbered years to coincide with either the presidential or midterm elections.
