Biden Jr. at his rally in Dallas on Monday night.Credit...Todd Heisler/The New York Times By Nick Corasaniti and Alexander Burns Published March 2, 2020Updated March 3, 2020 DALLAS — Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who entered the Democratic presidential race with an appeal to moderate voters and offered herself as a candidate who could win in Midwestern swing states, dropped out of the race on Monday and endorsed a rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “Today I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president,” she said at a rally here for the former vice president. She added: “He can bring our country together and build that coalition of our fired-up Democratic base as well as independents and moderate Republicans. We do not in our party want to just eke by a victory. We want to win big.” The decision came one day after former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., departed the race, and after weeks of Democratic Party hand-wringing about a crowded field of moderate candidates splitting a finite field of centrist votes, allowing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to march forward as the front-runner among progressives and amass delegates. Both Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg appeared with Mr. Biden at events in Dallas Monday night and endorsed him. Ms. Klobuchar began discussing a possible end with her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, on Sunday morning. But the candidate arrived at her final decision on Monday morning, catching some staff members by surprise as they were still making plans for campaign events later this week, and as her ad team was still making future reservations. Her rally in Salt Lake City on Monday morning carried no indication that she had any intention of dropping out of the race. Her exit means that her home state is up for grabs on Tuesday, as are its 75 pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders won Minnesota in 2016 and had been polling just a few percentage points behind Ms. Klobuchar there. At the rally on Monday night, Ms. Klobuchar turned to the dozens of television cameras and asked people “from my home state of Minnesota” to “vote for Joe.” “Vote for decency, vote for dignity, vote for a heart for our country,” she said. “That is what he will bring to the White House.” In a call with her staff on Monday morning, Ms. Klobuchar said she was proud of her “happy, scrappy campaign.” “I’ve been so proud that people have been willing to pitch in and help each other,” she said, according to an excerpt from the call. “And so that’s why this is a really hard thing to do today. But I really step back and think, ‘What is the best thing for us, and not just me, but our whole team?’ And I keep trying to think of what is best for our country right now. So I decided that I’m going to be endorsing Vice President Biden today.” Ms. Klobuchar, despite a strong third-place finish in New Hampshire, lagged her moderate rivals in every other state and was often seen as a candidate siphoning support. Though she had varying levels of support across the Super Tuesday map, polling within reach of leading candidates in some predominantly Republican states with open primaries, it is unclear how much of a boost any of her rivals will see in the wake of Ms. Klobuchar’s exit, or where she may direct her seven delegates. The senator from Minnesota shocked her rivals with her performance in New Hampshire, finishing ahead of better-known candidates like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Biden. But aside from New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar struggled deeply, lagging all of her competitors in Iowa, Nevada and South Carolina. Though her campaign received a much-needed influx of cash after New Hampshire — $12 million in just over a week — it proved too little, too late for the campaign to rapidly scale up and compete with her better funded and better organized rivals. The Klobuchar campaign was constantly rescheduling events, often releasing public advisories for an event with less than 24 hours’ advance notice. One “get out the caucus” rally in Nevada at Rancho High School attracted less than 100 people. Days before, Mr. Buttigieg brought more than 1,200 to the same school. Ms. Klobuchar was forced to cancel a rally in her own backyard Sunday night, after protesters from Black Lives Matter and local civil rights groups took over the stage in St. Louis Park, Minn. They were calling attention to the case of Myon Burrell, a black man convicted of murder as a teenager while Ms. Klobuchar was county attorney. Recent news reports have raised questions about the case, including numerous reported flaws with the prosecution. Ms. Klobuchar, while stopping short of apologizing, has called for the case to be reviewed. The frantic scramble to build out a national campaign followed a diligent and relentless focus on Iowa. Ms. Klobuchar was the first 2020 candidate to visit all 99 counties, and spent most of her time, money and field staff deployed to the state. Her self-described “gritty” effort in Iowa kept her on the debate stage, meeting polling thresholds in early states rather than in national polls. Listen to ‘The Daily’: Inside the Mind of a Super Tuesday VoterOne suburban voter — who has a personal history with Joe Biden — asks himself which moderate candidate has the best chance of beating President Trump. transcript Back to The Daily bars 0:00/35:10 -35:10 transcript Listen to ‘The Daily’: Inside the Mind of a Super Tuesday Voter Hosted by Michael Barbaro; produced by Jessica Cheung, Clare Toeniskoetter and Rachel Quester; with help from Robert Jimison; and edited by Lisa Tobin One suburban voter — who has a personal history with Joe Biden — asks himself which moderate candidate has the best chance of beating President Trump. michael barbaro From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: archived recording (crowd) Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, Bernie! michael barbaro In the first weeks of the Democratic primaries, Bernie Sanders was the only candidate to win big. And to win repeatedly. archived recording (bernie sanders) We won the popular vote in Iowa, we won the New Hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the A.P., we have now won the Nevada caucus! [CHEERING] michael barbaro In Nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he’d built a coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and Hispanic voters. In Iowa and New Hampshire, he did it by narrowly beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with the leading moderate candidate, Joe Biden, losing support and stumbling badly. archived recording The only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these delegates, and Sanders now has 43 of them. That’s more than his closest rival Pete Buttigieg at 26. And now you can see Sanders also has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in this race. michael barbaro All of this left Sanders the front-runner — archived recording Down-ballot Democrats are very worried about Bernie ending up at the top of the ballot, but there’s speculation that the rest of the folks — the moderates and others — can’t get it together, and they can’t stop Bernie. michael barbaro — and the only one who could walk away from Super Tuesday, today, as the likely Democratic nominee. Then came South Carolina. archived recording (joe biden) Just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. Now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the Democratic Party, we just won and we’ve won big because of you. michael barbaro And for the first time — archived recording (crowd) Let’s go Joe! Let’s go Joe! Let’s go Joe! michael barbaro — Joe Biden offered a vision of a different coalition, this one made up of black voters, older voters and suburbanites. archived recording Joe Biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every single county in the state, crushing Bernie Sanders by more than a 2-1 margin, with everyone else trailing badly. Biden’s big win helped him close the delegate gap considerably with Sanders. It’s very close. michael barbaro But South Carolina was just three days ago. archived recording Despite Biden’s big night, the confetti could stop for him on Super Tuesday, as Sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a potentially commanding delegate lead. michael barbaro And so the question now is, will Sanders sweep? Or, will the moderate wing of the party coalesce around Biden, and will the voters who had left him come back in time for Super Tuesday? It’s Tuesday, March 3. michael barbaro We are on a residential street in Arlington, Virginia. It’s a quite lovely neighborhood of colonial houses. I think it’s safe to say well-off. An affluent suburban community. clare toeniskoetter Can I do one of my favorite things? michael barbaro Which is what? clare toeniskoetter To look up how much these homes sell for? michael barbaro You would not be the first New Yorker to do that. clare toeniskoetter So this house right behind us — four beds, three baths, 2,600 square feet. Estimated price: $1.3 million. This house here, $1.3 million. No one’s ever going to invite me to their home after hearing this. [LAUGHS] They’ve still got a Christmas tree. knocking on door interposing voices Oh! Cute dog. Hi. michael barbaro You must be Brian. brian keane I’m Brian. michael barbaro I’m Michael. brian keane Hey, Michael. How are you? michael barbaro Jess, Clare. brian keane Jess, how are you? Nice to meet you. jessica cheung Hi! Nice to meet you. brian keane Clare, Brian KEANE. How are you? Nice to meet you. michael barbaro May we come in? brian keane Of course, of course. Nice to meet you. michael barbaro So on Sunday night I went with my colleagues Jessica Cheung and Clare Toeniskoetter to meet Brian Keane at his house in Arlington, a suburb about 15 minutes outside Washington, D.C. jessica cheung So cute in here. They’ve even got a fire going on. michael barbaro We get there — kate sawyer keane I’m Kate. Nice to meet you. michael barbaro — and he introduces us to his kids. brian keane So you met Tommy. And this is Julia, and this is Maddie, and this is Jack. jack keane Hello. brian keane And you met [INAUDIBLE] right? kate sawyer keane I just wanted to — michael barbaro There are so many of you! michael barbaro All five of them. And his dog, a yellow lab named Annie. And then we sit down in his living room. michael barbaro So, with your permission, we’ll start. brian keane Yes. michael barbaro Tell me who you are and what you do. brian keane So my name is Brian Keane, and I’m 52 years old. We’re here in Arlington, Virginia. michael barbaro So Brian, like a lot of people in Arlington, used to work on Capitol Hill. His wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many clients, the Democratic National Committee. He now runs a nonprofit organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable energy. michael barbaro So tell me about the politics of this community — Arlington, Virginia. brian keane Sure. It’s a wealthy community. And it’s a very well-read community, if you will. And the reason a lot of people kind of live here is because of the politics. And so they move to Washington — certainly that’s why I came here, because I love politics. michael barbaro What’s the kind of character of people’s political identification, if you could summarize it? brian keane It’s pretty easy to assume that they’re left of center. michael barbaro And you said left of center. My sense of this community is that that “center” word is important. That it’s left of center, but it’s not liberal “liberal.” I went back and looked at the 2016 primary for Arlington County and saw that Hillary Clinton won this county by a 2-to-1 ratio over Bernie Sanders. It wasn’t really even close. He got 32 percent. She got twice as much, 66 percent. brian keane We have a sense that if we’re going to be voting, we understand that you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don’t want to kind of just say like, oh, let’s just go crazy and vote for Mr. Potato Head because I think he’s great, and see what happens. michael barbaro But in the most recent polling, which was conducted before South Carolina, Sanders is actually leading the state of Virginia with 28 percent of the vote. Joe Biden has 19 percent, and Michael Bloomberg has 17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to Brian. archived recording (bernie sanders) Well, look. Let’s be clear. The establishment is freaking out. The establishment is worried. Wall Street is worried. The drug companies are worried. Insurance companies are worried. michael barbaro When he and his friends hear Sanders going after the establishment — brian keane When you say Washington’s the problem, he’s probably talking about us, and that’s not really well received. michael barbaro — they hear that as him going after them. brian keane Yeah, like any industry town would be, right? So if you’re going to say, the car manufacturers stink, I think Detroit would take umbrage to that. He’s just a little mean. I don’t think I’d like him as my neighbor. michael barbaro What about as your Democratic nominee? I mean, what do you — brian keane I think it would be really, really bad for the party. michael barbaro Why? brian keane I don’t think, for every — and I really, really think Trump is bad for America — a socialist revolution is not what we’re asking we need. And if we have a nominee to stand up against Trump that says we need a socialist revolution, we’re going to lose. And we will lose our Senate. We’ll lose any strong candidates we have in the Senate, and we have a lot of strong candidates. michael barbaro You mean it will trickle down over the whole party. brian keane Oh yeah. Badly. Badly. michael barbaro This is how you hear a lot of establishment Democrats talking right now, that a Sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party. michael barbaro Given what you just laid out, who do most of your neighbors tend to support in this primary? brian keane So it’s, I’ve been all over the board, though. Like it just moves so fast. And my personal thing is so interesting, though, because I’ve always — my heart has always been like, I’m a Joe Biden guy at heart. michael barbaro What do you mean? brian keane I love the guy, but can you win? And then in that case, it’s like, so I need to go with a guy that’s a person who’s going to win. And so now I’m, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win, and I have to give up the guy I love, you know? michael barbaro You say “I’m a Joe guy” with so much conviction that I kind of want to go back to understand what you mean by that. brian keane Well, I came to Washington, D.C. to go to college here at American University. And this is a long story. Can I tell my long story? michael barbaro Please tell a long story. We didn’t come here for a short story. brian keane [LAUGHS] You asked for it. But at American University — michael barbaro But, to summarize: Brian went to college at American University, where he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to campus, and Joe Biden was one of them. This was in 1988, and Biden had just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught plagiarizing a speech. And then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely survived. brian keane And so the speech he gave for the Kennedy Political Union at A.U. was his first speech after having been driven out of the race and his aneurysm. So he shows up — michael barbaro You’re there, obviously. brian keane Yes, right. So I’m there. I’m just a senior in college, I’m a kid. And he shows up. He gets out of this car, and he’s like my best friend. He’s like, Brian, it’s so great to see you! You have no idea how glad I am to see you. And I’m like, Senator Biden, so nice to meet you. No, you have no idea how glad I am to meet you — uh, to see you. Not meet you. You know, he’s very good. It’s like, in case he has met me before, he’s like, so glad to see you! And it was like [GASPS], we’re best friends. This is amazing. archived recording (brian keane) [APPLAUSE] Thank you. Good evening, and welcome to tonight’s program. My name is Brian F. KEANE, and I am the director of the Kennedy Political Union. brian keane Then we go to the lecture hall. archived recording (brian keane) Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. first entered public service in 1970 when he was elected to the Council of Newcastle County — excuse me — in New Jer— in Delaware. [LAUGHTER] Sorry. brian keane And — archived recording (brian keane) Ladies and gentlemen, Senator Joseph Biden. brian keane — he gives this unbelievable speech. archived recording (joe biden) Most of we public officials, when we’re about to speak somewhere, we start off and we say, I’m really happy to be here. Well folks, I’m happy to be here. I’m happy to be anywhere in light of [LAUGHS] the last 8 or 10 months. [APPLAUSE] brian keane And he kept going. archived recording (joe biden) I don’t see no leader right now of the Democratic Party who’s able to unite everyone. The Southern conservatives, the Northern liberals — brian keane He took every single question that was there. archived recording (joe biden) Well, the answer is yes. archived recording (crowd) [LAUGHTER] archived recording (joe biden) I’m serious. I’m serious. I’m serious. Don’t make me laugh. The answer is yes, I do see the possibility of uniting us so that we can win. brian keane They actually had to shut it down. They were like, we got to close the room. michael barbaro Senator, thank you very much — brian keane Exactly. Yeah, we’re done. archived recording (joe biden) [APPLAUSE] Thank you. brian keane And so, they shut the room down. So it’s, like, 11 o’clock at night now. And he says, hey, is there like a bar around here? And so I said, well, actually, there’s a tavern on campus. He’s like, oh, you got time? Let’s go get a beer. michael barbaro You’re having the proverbial beer with a politician in real life. brian keane And the guy was just great. Like it’s just me and Joe. And then he just says to the bartender, hey, how late are you guys open till? Last call, maybe 2 o’clock. Oh, great, great. Can I borrow your phone? Yeah. So he gives him his phone, and Joe dials and he goes, hey Beau, it’s Dad. I’m here at American University with Brian KEANE. Come on over. Get Hunter. Come on over, and let’s have a beer with Brian KEANE at American University. michael barbaro [LAUGHS] brian keane So the boys came over. And really, he was calling for a ride. [LAUGHS] And I was like, that was unbelievable. It was, like, the best night of my life. michael barbaro This is actually not the end of the story. brian keane To make this long story longer, that was 1989. So fast forward to 2007. There’s rumors that he’s going to run for president. So I’m taking the Amtrak, and I get to 30th Street Station and I go up the escalator. And I’m like, I think, just to myself, I’m like, I think that’s Joe Biden over there. And there’s a guy just holding the newspaper. He’s holding it up. And I said, excuse me, Mr. President. And he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. He looks me in the eye, and he goes, “American University.” michael barbaro Wow. brian keane And I go, oh my God! How do you remember that? That was 1989. He goes, that was a great night, wasn’t it? How are you man? How’s it going? How are you? And I said, well, are you running for president? And he’s like, well, why not? Like, why not? And so we got coffee, and then we waited in line for the Amtrak. And it was unbelievable. michael barbaro What impression did he leave you with? brian keane That he is the best politician. He loves people. And, actually, that is what the job is. And if you love people, you’re going to do well by people. michael barbaro So this time around, 2020, did you know right away? Did it feel like he was going to be your candidate? brian keane Well, I said to my wife, well, I got to go with Joe. We’re like best friends, you know? And she’s like, you don’t talk to the guy. laughter brian keane But I think it’s amazing that there’s a person that can make you feel like that. michael barbaro Right, in the race. brian keane Yes. So Joe enters 2020, and I said, well I got to be with Joe. michael barbaro Partly because of the relationship you had, partly because of his politics, all of it? brian keane Yeah, yeah. And that he is a Democrat’s Democrat to me. [music] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. michael barbaro Tell me about what’s happened since then. brian keane So I love Joe. Joe’s my guy. But he has not been a strong candidate. I think he doesn’t look good. I think he’s not sounding good. And Joe Biden, who is a great guy, is playing by a rulebook that was written in 1980 maybe, 1972. And that’s really concerning to me because Donald Trump’s going to fillet him very quickly. I mean, we’re seeing these debates. Joe Biden’s version of kind of hand-to-hand combat is to just say it louder, is to yell. archived recording (elizabeth warren) — things that touch people’s lives. archived recording (anchor) Mayor, mayor — archived recording (joe biden) I agree. Let me she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it, so lets get those things straight too. brian keane I kind of feel like I’m walking through a nursing home and seeing an old friend, and he’s just yelling at me. And it’s like, you’re an old friend, why are you yelling? He just says it louder, you know, and it’s like, stop yelling. archived recording (bernie sanders) — separate health care plan. archived recording Senator Klobuchar, I’m going to come to you. archived recording (joe biden) My name was mentioned. archived recording I’m going to come to you for 45 seconds. 45 seconds for Vice President Biden. archived recording (joe biden) I’m the only guy who’s not interrupted here, all right? And I’m going to interrupt now. It costs $30 trillion. Let’s get that straight. brian keane It’s like he doesn’t know how to take on his opponents without just yelling it. And he was stumbling on these words. archived recording (joe biden) I agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. I’m sorry. archived recording Thank you, Vice President. michael barbaro You just felt he was faltering. brian keane Yeah. michael barbaro So as you’re confronting what you see as his weaknesses, you’re watching these debate performances, it sounds like you’re starting to flirt with other candidates around this time. And where is your eye starting to drift? brian keane To everybody, actually. And then along comes Bloomberg. And there’s a guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to understand social media. And that’s really kind of cool. And on an electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with Trump on that and put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing. michael barbaro So when it comes to Bloomberg, for you he has this combination of values and resources. That’s the appeal. brian keane Yeah. And as such, he could win. michael barbaro And what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any reservations, given you pause? brian keane That he so quickly got off message and kind of got sidetracked. michael barbaro In the debates. brian keane Yeah, in the debates. And to me, the problem there is, oh, so now you’re going to go one-on-one with Trump? Maybe you’re not the guy. This is a problem. This all a game-day decision for me, right? So it’s — election’s Tuesday. So, you know, can Trump destroy Bloomberg? Can he destroy Biden? Yes and yes, perhaps. Who has kind of the better heart, and I think I have that answer, because Joe is the guy. I love Joe. Who has the money to be able to do this? Bloomberg does. But Biden’s victory in South Carolina, game changer for me. michael barbaro Really? brian keane Yeah. michael barbaro Why? brian keane I didn’t believe he was going to be able to do that. I didn’t believe him when he said, it’s a firewall. And the numbers are unbelievable. It’s like, wow. Joe did it. So then you come back to Bloomberg, and it’s like, well, I don’t know. michael barbaro Sounds like the thing that matters most you was just victory. Is seeing Joe Biden, this person who was faltering onstage, you didn’t like the way he was presenting, suddenly seeming electable because he had won an election? brian keane No. michael barbaro No? brian keane The winning was really important, but that speech — archived recording (joe biden) Thank you, thank you, thank you, South Carolina! brian keane — really grabbed me. archived recording (joe biden) Let me talk directly to Democrats across America, especially those who will be voting on Super Tuesday. brian keane And it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda. archived recording (joe biden) If Democrats want to nominate someone who will build on Obamacare, not scrap it; take on the N.R.A. and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. And if the Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat [CHEERING], a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us. brian keane And so now, he’s back. archived recording (joe biden) So here’s the deal. Let’s get back up. We’re decent. We’re brave. We’re resilient people. We can believe again. We’re better than this moment. We’re better than this president. So get up, take back our country. This the United States of America. There’s nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. God bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you. michael barbaro So at the moment — this is Sunday night, almost 9 o’clock — you are leaning toward Joe Biden. OK. What are the odds that you change your mind between now and Super Tuesday? brian keane It’s really amazing because I’m just so back and forth and back and forth every day. And every hour of every day. michael barbaro I want to talk about what I’m hearing you say, because I think this is a larger question happening in Virginia on Super Tuesday and part of the reason why we’re here, which is that it seems like aside from defeating Trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for you is not having Bernie Sanders be the nominee. Is that fair to say? brian keane A equals B, and B equals C. Because if my number one issue is to beat Trump, then we need the candidate who can do that. So that’s really the calculus that’s happening here. michael barbaro But I’m hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, Biden and Bloomberg. And the latest polling has Sanders with close to what he had in 2016 in Arlington. Biden and Bloomberg are around 20 percent too, because they’re sharing a lot of voters. So if on Super Tuesday, Sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like Virginia, it will likely have been because Biden and Bloomberg split the vote. And I wonder if you’re thinking about that at all. brian keane I am thinking about that. I think every other election has been like, oh, I don’t watch the polls. I just vote. I vote my heart. I vote the issues, you know? But now we’re all watching the polls. We’re all kind of — michael barbaro Gaming. brian keane It’s unbelievable, right? We all think we’re on CNN and it’s like, this is crazy. But we feel like we have to because the end game is which of these candidates can beat Trump? And that’s why I’m going to be looking at the polls. And I may actually delay my actual vote on Tuesday, unlike like — Usually, I vote before I go to work. But I may vote after work, depending on afternoon polling. Because if I want to vote for the candidate — if it looks like Virginia can — let’s see if I can say this right. If it looks like Bloomberg and Biden, if one of them is going to knock off Sanders in Virginia, I will vote for who can do that. michael barbaro So to be clear, Brian is saying that on election day, he is going to watch the early results come in before he goes to place his own vote. And his logic is that he’s going to try to limit the chance that a moderate split would lead to a Sanders win in Virginia. brian keane I think I’m being part of the solution, because I’m putting so much frigging effort into this thing. [LAUGHS] It’s unbelievable, you know? And it is. It’s amazing. And I think, actually, so many people are in my neighborhood and my friends, it’s really amazing. And people are saying, so what should I do? They’re really thinking this through. michael barbaro As Brian is talking, what he’s describing about the efforts that he and his friends and his neighbors are making is reminding me of what happened to the Republicans back in 2016. During the same time that year, the establishment was paralyzed by Donald Trump’s success with voters in the primaries. They were terrified of it, but they didn’t really know what to do about it and kind of did nothing, really. And then Trump basically ran away with Super Tuesday, and after that, by the time party leaders got organized and tried to stop him, it was too late. And people like Brian are a bit like the Democratic version of the Never Trump movement. They see Sanders as the Trump of the left, and they’re trying to do everything within their power to avoid that from happening on their side. michael barbaro I keep thinking about the way you’ve talked about Sanders and the risk he poses to the Democratic Party. If Sanders becomes the nominee, if it came down to it in a general election, Sanders versus Trump, what would you do? brian keane So for me, that’s really going to depend on his number two. michael barbaro There’s not an automatic “I’m going to be voting for the Democrat” coming out of your mouth right now. brian keane Correct. I might take some solace in a youthful vice president. Elizabeth Warren could get me for sure, for sure. michael barbaro Did you ever think you’d be in the position of imagining the front-runner in the Democratic presidential primary being a person that you can’t instantly say, I’d vote for? brian keane I could never imagine that the Democrats would nominate someone who’s not a Democrat. So that’s really the answer. And I don’t think we’ll nominate someone who is not a Democrat. archived recording (joe biden) Do you think that it’s inevitably hard for someone who lives in a community of expensive houses in suburban Virginia to ever really understand why people might want to break the system? brian keane No. I totally understand why people would want to break the system, and I really know the system doesn’t work for so many people. Millions and millions of people. It’s not a perfect union. I mean, really isn’t. But we are trying to create a perfect union. That’s kind of the beauty of the country. To use the language of revolution, it’s not responsible, it’s not helpful. It’s not really what we should be doing, especially against Trump. michael barbaro Well, thank you very much for your time. brian keane Thank you. michael barbaro I really appreciate it. brian keane Thank you so much.

We have someone — michael barbaro Sanders, appearing on CNN, dismissed the endorsements and suggested that they would have little impact. archived recording (bernie sanders) From day one, we have been taking on the establishment. And let me be very clear, it is no surprise they do not want me to become president. Because our administration will transform this country to create an economy and a government that works for all of the people — [music] michael barbaro We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. archived recording (dr. michael ryan) There is a point in any epidemic where you believe you can no longer contain the virus, like if it was influenza, and you have to shift your resources to saving lives. michael barbaro The coronavirus has now infected people on every continent except Antarctica. But global health officials said it was still possible for individual countries to contain the epidemic. archived recording (dr. michael ryan) But in doing that, you’re accepting that you can no longer affect the course of the disease. You can no longer change the shape of the epidemic, and you’re purely moving in that sense to save as many lives as you can. Now, W.H.O. does not believe that we’re there yet. michael barbaro During a news conference, the leaders of the World Health Organization said that the time for such containment was running out and urged countries to take every possible precaution. archived recording (dr. michael ryan) And if we’re lucky, and if we do the job really well, we may get the opportunity, we just might get the opportunity to interrupt transmission, but at the very — michael barbaro In Europe, the E.U. raised its alert level from moderate to high as the number of infections surged, reaching 18 of the E.U.‘s 27 nations. In South Korea, infections have doubled since Friday to more than 4,300. And in the U.S., as of Monday night, authorities had reported 100 cases and, in Washington State, six deaths from the virus. [music] That’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow. With a calm but prosecutorial demeanor mixed with a dry sense of humor, Ms. Klobuchar slowly built momentum through consecutive debate performances, seeing immediate spikes in cash and volunteers. But she never experienced a true “viral moment” — something she lamented in the closing days of her campaign while speaking in Nashville — forcing her to run a threadbare operation in every state outside of Iowa. Ms. Klobuchar famously kicked off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard a year ago, her nearly hourlong presidential announcement marked by the piles of snow that accumulated on her hatless head as she debuted her centrist message. On the campaign trail, she would refer frequently to her snowy beginnings as she continually pitched her Midwestern roots as a presidential credential, arguing that her “I live here” heartland appeal could win back states like Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, which President Trump carried in 2016. As a perpetual and direct contrast to the vocal liberal base of the Democratic Party, Ms. Klobuchar stubbornly stuck to a moderate message, one she hoped would appeal to independents and moderate Republicans. She vocally opposed “Medicare for all,” and built one of her most popular stump speech lines around defending the Affordable Care Act, claiming that it was “10 points more popular than the guy in the White House right now.” Her campaign also amounted to a bet that in a deeply polarized electorate, a bipartisan voting record could still be viewed as an asset in the Democratic electorate. She regularly highlighted the more than 100 bills that she had passed during her 14-year Senate career, and name-checked Republican senators whom she frequently worked with in her stump speech. But her bipartisan record also carried some risk; she was among the most likely Democratic senators to vote for a Trump judicial nominee, a point seized on by rivals like Mr. Buttigieg in debates. She struggled more than any other candidate to attract support in minority communities, particularly among black voters. And she faced calls from local civil rights organizations in Minneapolis, including the N.A.A.C.P. chapter, to suspend her campaign over the Burrell case. As she made her final run, Ms. Klobuchar abandoned South Carolina, the first state to vote with a meaningful black population, four days early. And her Super Tuesday campaign swing through 11 different states avoided the two biggest, and most diverse: Texas and California. But the senator kept her message upbeat throughout the campaign, and she always had her New Hampshire finish to point to, as she did in Nashville a few days before Super Tuesday. “We have been really, really beating the odds,” she said.
