[[File:John Adams crop.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]] was the first of 26 presidents who have been lawyers.]]

Among the 44 persons who have served as president, only [[Donald Trump]] had never held a position in either government or the military prior to taking office.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2017/04/23/525111191/trump-s-first-100-days-an-entry-level-presidency | title=Trump's First 100 Days: An 'Entry-Level' Presidency | publisher=NPR | first=Domenico | last=Montanaro | date=April 23, 2017 | accessdate=August 12, 2017}}</ref> The only previous experience [[Zachary Taylor]], [[Ulysses S. Grant]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] had was in the military. [[Herbert Hoover]] previously served as the [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]]. Everyone else served in elected public office before becoming president, such as being Vice President, a member of Congress, or a state or territorial governor.

Fourteen Presidents also served as vice president. However, only John Adams ([[1796 United States presidential election|1796]]), Thomas Jefferson ([[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]), [[Martin Van Buren]] ([[1836 United States presidential election|1836]]), [[Richard Nixon]] ([[1968 United States presidential election|1968]]) and [[George H. W. Bush]] ([[1988 United States presidential election|1988]]) began their first term after winning an election. The remaining nine began their first term as president according to the [[United States presidential line of succession|presidential line of succession]] after the intra-term death or resignation of their predecessor. Of these, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]], [[Harry S. Truman]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] were subsequently elected to a full term of their own, while [[John Tyler]], [[Millard Fillmore]], [[Andrew Johnson]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], and [[Gerald Ford]] were not. Ford's accession to the presidency is unique in American history in that he became vice president through the process prescribed by the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-fifth Amendment]] rather than by winning an election, thus making him the only U.S. president to not have been elected to either office.

Sixteen presidents had previously served in the U.S. Senate, including four of the five who served between 1945 and 1974. However, only three were incumbent senators at the time they were elected president ([[Warren G. Harding]] in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], [[John F. Kennedy]] in [[1960 United States presidential election|1960]], and [[Barack Obama]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]). Eighteen presidents had earlier served in the House of Representatives. However, only one was a sitting representative when elected to presidency ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]]).

Four of the last seven presidents ([[Jimmy Carter]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]] and [[George W. Bush]]) have been governors of a state. Geographically, these presidents were from either very large states (Reagan from [[California]], Bush from [[Texas]]) or from a state south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] and east of Texas (Carter from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Clinton from [[Arkansas]]). In all, sixteen presidents have been former governors, including seven who were incumbent governors at the time of their election to the presidency.

The most common job experience, occupation or profession of U.S. presidents has been lawyer;<ref>International Law, US Power: The United States' Quest for Legal Security, p. 10, Shirley V. Scott (2012)</ref> 26 presidents had served as attorneys. Twenty-two presidents were also in the military. Eight presidents had served as Cabinet Secretaries, with five of the six Presidents who served between 1801 and 1841 having held the office of [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]].

After leaving office, one president, [[William Howard Taft]], served as [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. Two others later served in Congress{{snd}}John Quincy Adams in the House and Andrew Johnson in the Senate.
