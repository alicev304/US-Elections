Arizona voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. On March 22, 2016, in the presidential primaries, Arizona voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic, Republican, and Green parties' respective nominees for president. (The Libertarian Party uses a privately funded caucus to select its presidential delegates and does not allow independents to vote in its primary.[1]) Registered members of each party only voted in their party's primary, while voters who were unaffiliated chose any one primary in which to vote, except in presidential elections.

Maricopa County in particular, went from a 10.69% margin of victory for Romney in 2012 to a 2.84% margin of victory for Trump—one of only three times that a Democrat has come closer to carrying the county since 1964. Indeed, the only closer margin since that time came in 1996, when Bill Clinton won it by 2.2%. Clinton also came close to winning Yuma County, and would have been the first Democrat to do so since the county was separated from La Paz County in the 1980s. Other rural counties that had been won by Bill Clinton in the 1990s continued to trend in a Republican direction. In terms of percentage of the vote, Trump's strongest support was in the northwest of the state whereas Clinton did best in the southern-central region. Electors[edit] Arizona had 11 electors in 2016. All of them voted for Donald Trump for president and Mike Pence for vice president. The electors were Bruce Ash Walter Begay Sharon Giese Robert Graham Alberto Gutier Jerry Hayden Carole Joyce Jane Pierpoint Lynch J.
