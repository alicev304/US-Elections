It provides nonpartisan information to the public with both general and state-specific information on the following aspects of the election process: Absentee ballot information Ballot measure information (where applicable) Early voting options (where applicable) Election dates Factual data on candidates in various federal, state and local races General information on such topics as how to watch debates with a critical eye ID requirements Polling place locations Registration deadlines Voter qualifications Voter registration forms Voting machines An important component of VOTE411.org is the polling place locator, which enables users to type in their address and retrieve the poll location for the voting precinct in which that address is located. The League has found that this is among the most sought after information in the immediate days leading up to, and on, Election Day. The League The League of Women Voters has fought since 1920 to improve U.S. systems of government and impact public policies through education and advocacy. The League's enduring vitality and resonance comes from its grassroots nature, with members operating at the national, state, and local levels working towards the goal of "making democracy work." There are Leagues in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Hong Kong, in addition to the hundreds of local Leagues nationwide. The League of Women Voters is strictly nonpartisan; it neither supports nor opposes candidates for office at any level of government. The League makes a difference at every level of government because of the energy and passion of thousands of members around the country who work together to safeguard our democracy.
