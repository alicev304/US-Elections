How to submit a letter to the editor – Help
HOME Help | Account | Contact Help Our newsroom and editorial processes Editorial concerns How to submit a letter to the editor Letters should be exclusive to The New York Times or The International New York Times. We do not publish open letters or third-party letters. We encourage a diversity of voices and views in our letters. Letters should preferably be 150 to 175 words, should refer to an article that has appeared within the last seven days, and must include the writer's address and phone number. No attachments, please. We regret that because of the volume of submissions, we cannot acknowledge unpublished letters other than by an automated e-mail reply. Writers of letters selected for publication will be notified within a week. Letters may be edited and shortened for space.
