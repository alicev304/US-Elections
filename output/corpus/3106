The COVID-19 virus has created uncertain times, and adapting to those times means adapting our caucus. To comply with social distancing recommendations, and to protect the public health, we expanded our vote-by-mail program to ensure every WyoDem has the opportunity to safely cast their vote. ‍‍‍ To vote in the caucus, you must have been a registered Wyoming Democrat as of March 20, 2020. This is the original voter registration deadline that has been extensively advertised for several months. All WyoDems who were registered by March 20 were automatically sent a ballot in the mail, to the address on their voter registration. The deadline to request a replacement ballot was March 31, 2020. Ballots must be mailed back to WDP (postage paid envelope is included) and received by April 17, 2020. Ballots received after April 17 will not be tabulated. Caucus results will be released as soon as possible; check back for updates on the finalized reporting date. Counties will hold delegate elections and conventions electronically, no later than May 24, 2020. This page will be updated to reflect dates, times, and registration instructions for county conventions.

Every registered Democrat in Wyoming who was registered to vote as of March 20, 2020 has been sent an official ballot in the mail. Voters will fill out this ballot and return it in the provided, postage-paid envelope to be tabulated. All ballots must be received by WDP no later than April 17, 2020. what is ranked-choice voting? Instead of choosing one candidate, voters rank each Democratic presidential candidate in order of preference. ‍ Ranked-choice voting ensures that every vote is counted, allowing voters the ability to fully participate in each round of voting. Here's how it works: ‍ what do the ballots look like? Official ballots began arriving in mailboxes March 5. If you were a registered Wyoming Democrat as of March 20, 2020, a ballot was automatically mailed to you. how do i become a delegate? To become a delegate to the state convention in Powell on June 6, 2020, you must file a statement of candidacy with the county party (as determined by the address at which you are registered to vote). Please contact your county party for their application form. To become a delegate to the national convention in Milwaukee July 13-16, you must file a statement of candidacy with the Wyoming Democratic Party, to be received by 5pm MDT on May 20, 2020. You can do this via the online form located here or by printing, signing, and returning the form located here. faqS • I didn't receive a ballot, what do I do? The deadline to request a replacement ballot was March 31, 2020. • Do I have to use the ballot mailed to me? Yes. The caucus is via mail-in vote only. • Why did I receive a ballot if I didn't request one? The 2020 WyoDem caucus is the most accessible ever--to ensure every voter has the chance to participate, we automatically mailed ballots to every registered WyoDem as of March 20, 2020. • Why are there candidates on the ballot who have dropped out of the race? Caucus planning takes a very long time--we've been working on this for months! Ballots were printed with all eligible candidates who had not requested ballot removal at the time of printing. If a candidate dropped out after our printing had begun, we didn't have the option to throw them all out and print again. Candidates who are still actively seeking the Democratic nomination for President of the United States are, in alphabetical order: Joseph R. Biden Bernie Sanders • Can I vote for a candidate who has dropped out? You can, but their delegates will eventually be assigned to remaining candidates based on their overall proportional vote. • Can I write in a candidate? You can select the "Undeclared" option on your ballot. • Where is my security sleeve? The Voter Instructions/Security Sleeve sheet are the same--once you've marked your ballot, fold the instructions/security sleeve around your ballot to obscure your choices, place them in the postage paid envelope, sign and date the exterior, and drop it in the mail! • Why do I have to write my birthday on the outside of the envelope? You don't! Only the date which you are signing. • I thought the nomination was already decided? Not yet! As of today (April 1), neither of the two remaining Democratic candidates have earned the number of delegates needed to be the nominee. We still have a long way to go before someone is chosen, and Wyoming's caucus deadline is April 17! • Does this mean I don't have to vote in the primary in August, or the general election in November? No! This caucus is only to decide who will be the Democratic nominee for President. It's still very important that you vote in the August primary; that's when we will choose our nominees for U.S. Senate, U.S. House, state house, state senate, even for mayor! In November, the Presidential nominee--and all of those other amazing candidates!--will still need your support to win election. Three elections in one year may seem like a lot, but it's better than another four years of what we've got! • I think something is wrong with my voter registration and no one is helping me. What can I do? Call the DNC Voter Protection Hotline at 833-DEM-VOTE (336-8683) • What are those important dates again? ‍ -March 20: Deadline to register to vote to participate in the caucus -March 31: Deadline to request a replacement ballot -April 17: Ballots must be received, via mail, by WDP • I'm a member of the media and would like to cover the caucus.
