Mitt Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, made an Election Day stop in Cleveland, crossing paths with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And voters turned out in large numbers in the counties around Ohio’s three major cities — Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati — keeping the race between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney a cliffhanger. But in the end, Mr. Obama’s strong performance in other swing states allowed him to secure re-election before Ohio had been called. National exit polls showed, as the Obama campaign had hoped, that 59 percent of those voting in Ohio approved of the federal government’s bailout of the auto industry. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, also held on to his Senate seat after an expensive fight against the Republican state treasurer, Josh Mandel. Outside groups on both sides poured tens of millions of dollars into the race, which had been seen early on as a vulnerability for Democrats, who hold a Senate majority. But Mr. Mandel had trouble fending off questions about his handling of payroll taxes for staff members of his campaign for treasurer, and Mr. Brown held on to the edge he had gained in the polls. The loss of two House seats after the 2010 census and redistricting favored Republicans in the House races. In the hotly contest 16th District, two sitting House members, James B. Renacci, a Republican, and Betty Sutton, a Democrat, were forced to square off in an expensive race that Mr. Renacci ultimately won. Tax issues played a role in the 16th District, where Mr. Renacci had to defend himself after advertisements pointed out his long-running dispute with the Ohio Department of State over whether he and his wife should have reported $13.7 million in income, rather than a $247,336 loss. He eventually paid back taxes but is still arguing over penalties and interest. Representative Steve Austria, a moderate Republican from the Seventh District, did not seek re-election after being pushed out of the district. Representative Bob Gibbs, a Republican from the soon-to-vanish 18th District, took his place, having defeated Joyce Healy-Abrams, a Democrat and a retired business consultant whose father, William J. Healy, was a longtime state legislator. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been certain the Sixth District was going to swing in the party's favor this year, but Representative Bill Johnson, a Republican, hung on to his seat. Samuel Wurzelbacher, better known as Joe the Plumber, the outspoken citizen who was embraced by John McCain and Sarah Palin during the 2008 presidential campaign, lost his bid for a House seat to Representative Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat, who will start her 16th term in January.
