Conservative Political Action Conference From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Annual political conference in the US Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC 2019 logo Dates February/March (dates vary) Frequency Annual Location(s) National Harbor, Maryland, U.S. Inaugurated 1973; 47 years ago (1973) Most recent February 27–March 2, 2019 Organized by American Conservative Union Website cpac.conservative.org The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC; /ˈsiːpæk/ SEE-pak) is an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and elected officials from across the United States and beyond. CPAC is hosted by the American Conservative Union (ACU).[1] In 2011, ACU took CPAC on the road with its first Regional CPAC in Orlando, Florida. Since then ACU has hosted regional CPACs in Chicago, Denver, St. Louis, and San Diego. Political front runners take the stage at this convention.[citation needed] The 2019 CPAC took place at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center from February 27 to March 2, 2019.[2][better source needed] The 2020 CPAC took place at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center from February 26 to February 29, 2020,[3] with special guest President Donald Trump speaking on Saturday.

Bush speaking at the 2008 CPAC President Donald Trump speaking at the 2018 CPAC The conference was founded in 1974 by the American Conservative Union and Young Americans for Freedom as a small gathering of dedicated conservatives.[4][5][6] Ronald Reagan gave the inaugural keynote speech at CPAC in 1974.[7] Like the conference's speakers today, the presidential hopeful used it to share his vision for the country—"A Shining City Upon A Hill," words borrowed from John Winthrop.[8] Controversies[edit] This section appears to be slanted towards recent events. Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. (March 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2014, CPAC extended an invitation to the American Atheists, which was immediately withdrawn on the same day due to controversial statements by AA's president David Silverman, who declared his group was going to "enlighten conservatives" and that "the Christian right should be threatened by us."[9] Richard Spencer, a figurehead of the Alt-Right and a white supremacist, entered the lobby of the Gaylord National Hotel on February 23, 2017 in an attempt to access CPAC. Organizers of the conference ejected him from the hotel as soon as his presence was discovered, citing his "repugnant [views which] ... have absolutely nothing to do with conservatism or what we do here" as cause for rejecting his admission to CPAC.[10] ACU's Executive Director Dan Schneider castigated Spencer and the alt-right in a main-stage speech, calling them "garden-variety, left-wing fascists," and saying that the alt-right "despises everything [conservatives] believe in."[11][12] Media members across the political spectrum, led by progressive journalists and opinion columnists, salvoed the intrusion as yet another attempt by hateful groups, like the alt-right, to conceal their bigotry within a legitimate philosophy. Opinion columns in The New York Times, and articles in Mother Jones and Rolling Stone voiced concern about the 2017 interview of ex-Trump Adviser Steve Bannon and ex-Trump Chief of Staff Reince Priebus with ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp, advocating for the American Right to reject the tenets of the alt-right (e.g. homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, racism, etc.).[13][14][15] Fringe groups at CPAC[edit] The 2010 CPAC featured co-sponsorship for the first time from the John Birch Society and GOProud, a gay conservative group. GoProud is credited in the media for initiating talks with ACU to invite Donald Trump to speak at CPAC 2011.[16] The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[17][18][19] Christopher R. Barron, co-founder of GOProud who would later not only endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but also launch LGBT for Trump, said he "would love to see Mr. Trump run for president." The 2015 CPAC featured Jamila Bey who became the first atheist activist to address CPAC's annual meeting.[20] The 2016 CPAC featured co-sponsorship for the first time from the Log Cabin Republicans.[21] Milo Yiannopoulos invitation[edit] Main article: Milo Yiannopoulos § Alleged support for paedophilia In December 2016, CPAC extended an invitation to conservative blogger Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at the event, despite his history of controversial views on feminism, racial minorities, and transgender issues. The invitation was canceled when the Reagan Battalion re-posted a video of 2016 and 2015 YouTube videos[22] in which Yiannopoulos is heard making comments defending sexual relationships between adult men and 13-year-old boys, citing his own sexual experiences at that age with a Catholic priest.[23] 2020 COVID-19 exposures[edit] On Saturday, March 7, 2020, ACU confirmed that an attendee at the 2020 CPAC later tested positive for Coronavirus disease 2019. Senator Ted Cruz, Representatives Matt Gaetz, Paul Gosar, Doug Collins, and Mark Meadows had direct contact with the unnamed carrier, and announced their self-quarantine.[24][25] Annual straw poll[edit] Straw poll results at the 2015 CPAC The annual CPAC straw poll vote traditionally serves as a barometer for the feelings of the conservative movement. During the conference, attendees are encouraged to fill out a survey that asks questions on a variety of issues. The questions regarding the most popular possible presidential candidates are the most widely reported. One component of CPAC is evaluating conservative candidates for president, and the straw poll serves generally to quantify conservative opinion.

Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp and Rand Paul follow with three consecutive wins each, followed by Ron Paul with two wins. Of these five, the Pauls are the only two to win more than one straw poll, yet never appear on a Republican presidential ticket in any election (although Ron Paul did receive one Electoral College vote in 2016).[51] Despite his former popularity, Romney was uninvited from CPAC in 2020 for his vote to remove the president impeachment trial of Donald Trump.[52] Awards[edit] Since 2007, the Jeane Kirkpatrick Academic Freedom Award has been presented at CPAC in memory of Jeane Kirkpatrick. The award is sponsored by the Bradley Foundation, and its first recipient was Matt Sanchez.[53][54] In 2010, the Ronald Reagan Award was given to the Tea Party movement, which marked the first time it was ever given to a group instead of an individual.[55] Foreign CPACs[edit] Australia[edit] Australia's first CPAC was held in August 2019, with guest speakers including former prime minister Tony Abbott, Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage, former Breitbart editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam and NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham. Liberal Senator Amanda Stoker and Craig Kelly MP were at the event. There have been calls for Kassam to be banned from coming into the country before the event.[56][57] The US backers of the right-wing Australian conference say the CPAC event won't be a one-off.[58] Brazil[edit] The first CPAC in Brazil took place between 11–12 October 2019, in the city of São Paulo, attended by leading conservative names from U.S. like ACU chairman Matt Schlapp and his wife Mercedes Schlapp, Utah senator Mike Lee, Fox News especialist Walid Phares, and Brazilian names like Federal deputy and the President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Ernesto Araújo, and the Prince Imperial of Brazil Bertrand Maria José de Orléans e Bragança and others.[59][60] The ACU Foundation has announced that the event will take place annually in Brazil from 2019.[61][62] See also[edit] Conservatism portal References[edit] ^ "CPAC 2015 Straw Poll: Rand Paul wins again – but Scott Walker is surging".
