  T Brand Work Method Impact Allbirds Visualizing Birds’ Beautiful Role in Sustainability Exploring how birds nurture their environment to boost sustainable commerce Allbirds is a champion of sustainability and protecting the environment. But too few consumers know this. And many still see Allbirds as simply a sneaker brand.

We brought five bird species to life via a series of looping, kinetic computer graphics complemented by soundscapes of birdsong and substantiated by a reported narrative.
