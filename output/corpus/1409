United States presidential elections in Texas From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Presidential elections in Texas No. of elections 41 Voted Democratic 27 Voted Republican 14 Voted other 0 Voted for winning candidate 25 Voted for losing candidate 16 Following is a table of United States presidential elections in Texas, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1845, Texas has participated in every U.S. presidential election except the election of 1864 during the American Civil War, when the state had seceded to join the Confederacy, and the election of 1868, when the state was undergoing Reconstruction. In its first century Texas was a Democratic bastion, only voting for another party once – in 1928 when anti-Catholic sentiment against Al Smith drove voters to Republican Herbert Hoover. A gradual trend towards increasing social liberalism in the Democratic Party, however, has turned the state (apart from Hispanic South Texas, the Trans-Pecos and several large cities) into a Republican stronghold. Since 1980 Texas has voted Republican in every election. Winners of the state are in bold.

McClellan — Election of 1860[edit] The election of 1860 was a complex realigning election in which the breakdown of the previous two-party alignment culminated in four parties each competing for influence in different parts of the country. The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War.
