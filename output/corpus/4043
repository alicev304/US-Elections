They are generally defined as, "the act of causing some state matters to be published or made generally known. A written or printed document in which are contained such matters, issued by proper authority; as the president's proclamation, the governor's, the mayor's proclamation."[1] An administrative order (i.e., findings, letters, orders) can be issued.[2] Administrative orders are published in the Federal Register in forms other than those of executive orders, or proclamations, have been denominated as administrative orders when reproduced in CFR Title 3 compilations."[2] A research guide by the National Archives defined administrative orders as "unnumbered signed documents through which the President of the United States conducts the administrative operations of the Federal Government" which "include but are not limited to memoranda, notices, determinations, letters, and messages."[3] A presidential notice or a presidential sequestration order can also be issued.[4][5] The newest executive power, national security presidential memoranda,2 operate like executive orders, but are only in the area of national security. They date back to President Harry S. Truman and have been called many different names.1[6] Executive orders, presidential memoranda, presidential determinations, presidential proclamations, administrative orders, presidential notices, presidential sequestration orders, and national security presidential memoranda are compiled by the Office of the Federal Register (within the National Archives and Records Administration) and are printed by the Government Printing Office. They are published daily, except on federal holidays. A free source of these documents is the Federal Register, which contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices.[7] There are no copyright restrictions on the Federal Register; as a work of the U.S. government, it is in the public domain.[8] Listed below are the presidential proclamations beginning with 9570 signed by United States President Donald Trump. As of March 13, 2019, there have been 280 presidential proclamations signed by President Trump.

However, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration ordered their national security directives to be published in the Federal Register.[594] ^ National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directives address continuity of government in the event of a "catastrophic emergency" disrupting the U.S. population, economy, environment, infrastructure and government policy. ^ United States Statutes at Large: Pub.L. 101–355 of August 10, 1990. ^ Proclamation 9645 of September 24, 2017, supplements EO 13780 of March 6, 2017. ^ On October 17, 2017, Judge Derrick Watson, of the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii issued another temporary restraining order that was asked by the state of Hawaii. Watson's decision noted that the latest ban "suffers from precisely the same maladies as its predecessor" as it "plainly discriminates based on nationality" and as such violates federal law and "the founding principles of this Nation."[595] ^ Made into effect by: Pub.L. 88–628, 78 Stat. 1003 of October 6, 1964. ^ Trump chose to observe the entire month of November to United States Veterans & their families and the traditional Veterans Day (36 U.S.C. § 145). ^ Pub.L. 100–166, 101 Stat. 384 ^ Native Americans of the group United American Indians of New England in Plymouth, Massachusetts had their 48th annual solemn National Day of Mourning observance.[596] ^ On December 6, 2017, American clothing company Patagonia, Inc. sued the United States Government and President Donald Trump for his proclamations of reducing the Bears Ears National Monument by 85% and almost 50% of Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The company believes that a million acres of land is at risk for permanent destruction. Patagonia is suing over the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution in where it vests Congress with the power to manage federal lands. The company's CEO Rose Marcario contends that when Congress passed the Antiquities Act of 1906 (Pub.L. 59–209, 34 Stat. 225, 54 U.S.C. §§ 320301–320303), "Congress delegated a limited amount of power to the President — specifically, the authority to create national monuments protecting certain federal land. But it did not give the President the power to undo a prior president's monument designations. It kept that power for itself."[597] Citations[edit] ^ "Proclamation". Lectlaw.com.
