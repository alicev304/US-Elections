In addition, special elections may take place (depending on state law) if other gubernatorial seats are vacated. The last regular gubernatorial elections for nine of the eleven states took place in 2016. The last gubernatorial elections for New Hampshire and Vermont took place in 2018, as the governors of both states serve two-year terms. All state governors will be eligible for reelection [a] except for Steve Bullock of Montana, although other governors may choose to retire. The 2020 gubernatorial elections will take place concurrently with several other federal, state, and local elections, including the presidential election.

Montana's popular Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, is term-limited, but his lieutenant governor is the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, making the race competitive in a state Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016. New Hampshire is a Democratic leaning state with a Republican governor, Chris Sununu, and seeing as Democrats made major gains in the state in 2018, Sununu faces a tough reelection, despite being relatively popular. North Carolina is a Republican-leaning state with a Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, meaning that Cooper faces a tough reelection as well. Vermont is the only other race that could become competitive, however, Republican incumbent Phill Scott is ranked one of the most popular governors in the United States and there are no formidable Democratic challengers. The gubernatorial races in Delaware and Washington are seen as safe for Democrats, while Indiana, Missouri, North Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia are seen as safe for Republicans. Several sites and individuals publish predictions of competitive seats. These predictions look at factors such as the strength of the incumbent (if the incumbent is running for re-election), the strength of the candidates, and the partisan leanings of the state (reflected in part by the state's Cook Partisan Voting Index rating). The predictions assign ratings to each seat, with the rating indicating the predicted advantage that a party has in winning that seat. Most election predictors use "tossup" to indicate that neither party has an advantage, "lean" to indicate that one party has a slight advantage, "likely" or "favored" to indicate that one party has a significant but not insurmountable advantage, and "safe" or "solid" to indicate that one party has a near-certain chance of victory. Some predictions also include a "tilt" rating that indicates that one party has an advantage that is not quite as strong as the "lean" rating would indicate.

The only candidate declared in the Democratic primary is community activist David Williams. No Republican has announced a run for governor yet.

State auditor Nicole Galloway is running for the Democratic nomination.[39] Montana[edit] Main article: 2020 Montana gubernatorial election Two-term incumbent governor Steve Bullock is term-limited in 2020, making him the only incumbent governor in the United States (not counting U.S. territories) who is term-limited in that election year. While Democratic lieutenant governor Mike Cooney is the current frontrunner in the Democratic primary, businesswoman and daughter of former U.S. Representative Pat Williams, Whitney Williams is challenging him in the primary.[40][41] Republican candidates include Attorney General Tim Fox, state senator Albert Olszewski, and Montana at-large representative Greg Gianforte.[42][43][44] New Hampshire[edit] Main article: 2020 New Hampshire gubernatorial election In December 2019, two-term incumbent governor Chris Sununu announced that he would run for a third term in 2020, ending speculation he would choose to run for the U.S. Senate instead.[45] New Hampshire Senate majority leader Dan Feltes and Executive Council of New Hampshire member Andru Volinsky are seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Sununu.[46] North Carolina[edit] Main article: 2020 North Carolina gubernatorial election One-term incumbent governor Roy Cooper is running for re-election in 2020.

Pierluisi is challenging her in the New Progressive Party primary. Candidates vying for the Popular Democratic Party nomination include former Puerto Rican Senate president Eduardo Bhatia, San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz, and Isabela mayor Carlos Delgado Altieri. Senator Juan Dalmau of the Puerto Rican Independence Party and Alexandra Lúgaro of the Movimiento Victoria Ciudadana party are also on the ballot.[28] Utah[edit] Main article: 2020 Utah gubernatorial election Two and a half-term incumbent governor Gary Herbert is eligible for re-election in 2020, as Utah does not have gubernatorial term limits. However, he announced shortly after being re-elected in 2016 that he will not run for a third full term. He has since stated that he would "never say never" to running for reelection.[49] Josh Romney (son of Senator Mitt Romney) has expressed interest in running.[50] Vermont[edit] Main article: 2020 Vermont gubernatorial election Two-term incumbent governor Phil Scott has confirmed he is seeking a third term in 2020, however, he has not publicly announced his campaign.[14] On the Democratic side, Lt Governor David Zuckerman is running.[51] Washington[edit] Main article: 2020 Washington gubernatorial election Two-term incumbent governor Jay Inslee is eligible to run for re-election in 2020, as Washington does not have gubernatorial term limits. Inslee is running for re-election to a third term after dropping out of the presidential race on August 21, 2019.[52][53] West Virginia[edit] Main article: 2020 West Virginia gubernatorial election One-term incumbent governor Jim Justice is running for re-election in 2020. Justice was elected as a Democrat, but later switched to the Republican Party.[54] Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, retired Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton,[54] and Secretary of State Mac Warner were mentioned as potential general election challengers, prior to Justice's decision to re-join the Republican Party.
