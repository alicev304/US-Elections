This allowed them to have a separate church and minister, but were still under jurisdiction of the Town of Cambridge. Lexington was incorporated as a separate town in 1713. It was then that it got the name Lexington.[4] How it received its name is the subject of some controversy. Some people believe that it was named in honor of Lord Lexington, an English peer.[5] Some, on the other hand, believe that it was named after Lexington (which was pronounced and is today spelled Laxton) in Nottinghamshire, England.[6] In the early colonial days, Vine Brook, which runs through Lexington, Burlington, and Bedford, and then empties into the Shawsheen River, was a focal point of the farming and industry of the town. It provided for many types of mills, and in the 20th Century, for farm irrigation. Aerial View a Lexington neighborhood Battle of Lexington[edit] See also: Battles of Lexington and Concord On April 19, 1775, what many regard as the first battle of the American Revolutionary War was the Battle at Lexington. On the night of April 18, The British Army had set out 700 troops on foot from Boston, with the intention of destroying Colonial gunpowder and cannons that was being stored in Concord, as well as capturing Sons of Liberty leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams.[7] Word got out due to riders Paul Revere, William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, who alerted local minuteman of the British Movements. Once the British arrived on the Lexington Common, they faced 77 Minuteman of the Lexington Militia, commanded by Captain John Parker. Somebody-still unknown to this day, fired a shot, provoking an exchange of fire between both sides.[7] Eight Minutemen were killed, dozens more wounded. After the rout, the British march on toward Concord where the militia had been allowed time to organize at the Old North Bridge and turn back the British and prevent them from capturing and destroying the militia's arms stores.[8] Today, the town annually commemorates the battle on the Battle Green in the Downtown with a reenactment, as part of its Patriots Day festivities. Painting of the Battle of Lexington Urbanization[edit] For decades after the Revolutionary War, Lexington grew modestly while remaining largely a farming community, providing Boston with much of its produce. Many of these farms became dense housing developments and subdivisions by the 1970s. Lexington always had a bustling downtown area, which remains to this day. Lexington began to prosper, helped by its proximity to Boston, and having a rail line (originally the Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad, later the Boston and Maine Railroad) service its citizens and businesses, beginning in 1846 until 1981. In 1984, Due to the rapid urbanization that occurred in many other suburbs like Lexington, The MBTA proposed expanding the Red Line through Lexington, terminating in Bedford. Despite Lexington and Bedford being on board with the idea, Arlington residents lobbied against the plan and it was shot down by the Board of Selectmen.[9] Lexington, as well as many of the towns along the Route 128 corridor, experienced a jump in population in the 1960s and 70s, due to the high-tech boom. Today, many companies are still moving into Lexington, with Takeda and BAE Systems both having huge offices. The urbanization and massive job growth resulted in Property values soar, and the school system becoming nationally recognized for its excellence.[10] The town participates in the METCO program, which buses minority students from Boston to suburban towns to receive better educational opportunities than those available to them in the Boston Public Schools.[11] Lexington was the Cold War location of the USAF "Experimental SAGE Subsector"[12] for testing a prototype IBM computer that arrived in July 1955[13] for development of a computerized "national air defense network"[14] (the namesake "Lexington Discrimination System" for incoming ICBM warheads was developed in the late 1960s).[15] Geography[edit] Lexington is located at 42°26′39″N 71°13′36″W﻿ / ﻿42.44417°N 71.22667°W﻿ / 42.44417; -71.22667 (42.444345, -71.226928).[16] According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 16.5 square miles (42.8 km²), of which 16.4 square miles (42.5 km²) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.4 km²), or 0.85%, is water. Lexington borders Burlington, Woburn, Winchester, Arlington, Belmont, Waltham, Lincoln, and Bedford. It has more area than all other municipalities that it borders.

This racial diversity is largely reflected in the Lexington Public Schools, which has led the district to its well known academic excellence. According to U.S. News & World Report, Lexington High School is the fourth best in the state.[32] Many who move to Lexington do so for the outstanding education opportunities in the town, thus creating a cycle of a rapidly growing Asian population and an increase in education academic rankings[33] Government and Politics[edit] The town uses a five-member Select Board. The day-to-day operations are handled by a Town Manager hired by the Select Board. A Representative town meeting, acts as the legislative body, made up of 203 members, including 21 citizens elected from each of nine precincts for three-year staggered terms, At-large member positions include the Select Board, Town Counsel, Town Clerk and the School Committee chairman.[34] Article LXXXIX Section 8 of the Massachusetts Constitution permits towns with a population greater than 12,000 to adopt a city form of government. The Town of Lexington meets the population requirement to become a city, but has not done so, in part because it would lose its ability to engage citizens in local government under the Representative Town Meeting form of government. Lexington is Represented by State Representative Michelle Ciccolo, State Senators Cindy Friedman and Michael Barrett, all Democrats. Lexington is in Massachusetts's 5th congressional district, currently represented by Katherine Clark. Federally, Lexington is heavily Democratic, having not voted Republican since 1980.
