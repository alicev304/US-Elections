way understand space affect human body help nasa astronaut better prepare mission will get longer current schedule sixmonth stay space station will give way longer stay nasa artemis program will human moon 2024 eventually land surface mars new study suggest longterm spaceflight permanently cause change brain volume deform pituitary gland pituitary gland also call master gland tiny structure base skull responsible function multiple gland human body study publish tuesday journal radiology read astronauts longterm mission aboard space station complain nasa call spaceflightassociated neuroocular

connect eye brain retinal bleeding fluffy white patch retina change eye structure longterm spaceflight squeeze brain study say multiple study center phenomenon ease astronaut well detect possible change brain cause spaceflight microgravity fluid venous blood longer pool toward lower extremity redistribute headward say dr larry kramer university texas health science center houston lead study author movement fluid toward head may one mechanism cause change observe eye intracranial compartment eleven astronaut 10 man one woman agree participate study longterm spaceflight mission space station undergo brain mri flight one day several time next year astronaut struggle sleep among star five astronaut previous spaceflight experience six none accord study average time spend astronaut space average 171 day researcher notice brain cerebrospinal fluid volume astronaut expand increase 2 cerebrospinal fluid find surround spinal cord well brain hollow space fluid enrich protect brain comparison astronaut brain left longterm spaceflight show expansion brain volume increase remain one year spaceflight lead researcher believe change permanent identify one really identify significant increase volume brain white matter preflight postflight kramer say white matter expansion fact responsible largest increase combined brain cerebrospinal fluid volume postflight astronaut experienced reverse blood flow blood clot space station study say pituitary gland six astronaut study also show sign deformation likely response pressure inside skull find pituitary gland lose height smaller postflight preflight dr kramer say addition dome pituitary gland predominantly convex astronaut without prior exposure microgravity show evidence flatten concavity postflight type deformation consistent exposure elevated intracranial pressure astronaut exercise program may help cancer patient researcher say postflight analysis also show astronaut lateral ventricle increase volume area

previous issue associate spaceflight like bone muscle loss mitigate space station addition exercise equipment recommendation astronaut workout least two hour day mission mars cause learn impairment anxiety study say researcher also try find countermeasure combat fluid shift head pressure one include suit space station use pressure draw fluid back toward lower limb another possible idea
