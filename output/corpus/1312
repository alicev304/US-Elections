From "The Free Dictionary" This Day in History This Day in History provided by The Free Dictionary Today's Birthday Today's Birthday provided by The Free Dictionary In the News In the News provided by The Free Dictionary Quote of the Day No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be true. Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) Quote of the Day provided by The Free Library What is politics? According to Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, politics is "the art or science of government" or "the art or science concerned with guiding or influencing government policy." In the minds of most Americans, however, the one word that comes to mind when we hear any mention of politics is "elections." Elections, which are the choosing of candidates for public offices, are the high point of the political spectrum. They're a time when all candidates gear up for an exciting and (usually) unpredictable campaign season. All elections in the United States culminate every four years during the most watched election campaign in the world: the U.S. presidential election. Since the adoption of the Constitution in 1788, presidential elections in America have changed quite a bit. For example, back then the presidential and vice-presidential candidates ran separately, but today they run on the same ticket. Back in 1788, there were no such things as political parties. Today, parties are the only things that make presidential elections competitive. On this website, we aim to collect all information known about presidential elections from the first in 1789 to the most recent in 2004. We even offer opinion polls from time to time and information on the 2008 race for the White House. So rest assured, if you came here looking for the most accurate presidential election information, your search is over. Contact us Have any questions or comments?
