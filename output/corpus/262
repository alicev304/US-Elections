Article Two of the Constitution originally established the method of presidential elections, including the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]]. This was a result of a compromise between those constitutional framers who wanted the Congress to choose the president, and those who preferred a national popular vote.<ref>{{cite book |first = Gary |last = Bugh |title=Electoral College Reform: Challenges and Possibilities |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC |year=2010 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-7546-7751-2 |page = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XdSmtbZg9_YC&pg=PA40 40] }}</ref>

Each state is allocated a number of electors that is equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of Congress combined. With the ratification of the Twenty-third Amendment in 1961, the District of Columbia is also granted a number of electors, equal to the number of those held by the least populous state. However, U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College.

Constitutionally, the manner for choosing electors is determined within each state by its legislature; Article{{nbsp}}II, Section{{nbsp}}1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 states that each state shall appoint electors "in such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct".<ref>[[Richard A. Epstein]], [https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5103&context=uclrev {{"'}}In Such Manner as the Legislature Thereof May Direct": The Outcome in ''Bush v Gore'' Defended], 68 ''University of Chicago Law Review'' 613, 614 (2001).</ref> During [[1788–89 United States presidential election|the first presidential election in 1789]], only 6 of the 13 original states chose electors by any form of popular vote.{{NoteTag|Of the 13 original states during the [[1788–89 United States presidential election|1789 election]], six states chose electors by some form of popular vote, four states chose electors by a different method, [[North Carolina]] and [[Rhode Island]] were ineligible to participate since they had not yet ratified the U.S. Constitution, and [[New York (state)|New York]] failed to appoint their allotment of electors in time because of a deadlock in their state legislature.}} Gradually throughout the years, the states began conducting popular elections to choose their slate of electors. In 1800, only five of the 16 states chose electors by a popular vote; by 1824, after the rise of [[Jacksonian democracy]], the proportion of states that chose electors by popular vote had sharply risen to 18 out of 24 states.<ref name="Norton">Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation: A History of the United States'', Vol. I (11th ed. 2019), p. 340.</ref> This gradual movement toward greater [[democratization]] coincided with a gradual decrease in [[Voting rights in the United States|property restrictions for the franchise]].<ref name="Norton"/> By [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], only one of the 26 states ([[South Carolina]]) still selected electors by the state legislature.<ref>Donald Richard Deskins, Hanes Walton & Sherman C. Puckett, ''Presidential Elections, 1789–2008: County, State, and National Mapping of Election Data'' (University of Michigan Press, 2010), p. 117.</ref>

Under the original system established by Article Two, electors could cast two votes to two different candidates for president. The candidate with the highest number of votes (provided it was a majority of the electoral votes) became the president, and the second-place candidate became the vice president. This presented a problem during the [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]] when [[Aaron Burr]] received the same number of electoral votes as [[Thomas Jefferson]] and challenged Jefferson's election to the office. In the end, Jefferson was chosen as the president because of [[Alexander Hamilton]]'s influence in the House.

In response to the 1800 election, the Twelfth Amendment was passed, requiring electors to cast two distinct votes: one for president and another for vice president. While this solved the problem at hand, it ultimately had the effect of lowering the prestige of the vice presidency, as the office was no longer for the leading challenger for the presidency. The separate ballots for president and vice president became something of a moot issue later in the 19th century when it became the norm for popular elections to determine a state's Electoral College delegation. Electors chosen this way are pledged to vote for a particular presidential and vice presidential candidate (offered by the same political party). So, while the Constitution says the president and vice president are chosen separately, in practice they are chosen together.

The Twelfth Amendment also established rules when no candidate wins a majority vote in the Electoral College. In the [[1824 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1824]], [[Andrew Jackson]] received a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]], but not a majority, of electoral votes cast. The election was thrown to the House, and [[John Quincy Adams]] was elected president. A deep rivalry resulted between Andrew Jackson and House Speaker [[Henry Clay]], who had also been a candidate in the election.

Since 1824, aside from the occasional "faithless elector", the popular vote determines the winner of a presidential election by determining the electoral vote, as each state or district's popular vote determines its electoral college vote. Although the nationwide popular vote does not directly determine the winner of a presidential election, it does strongly correlate with who is the victor. In 53 of the 58 total elections held so far (about 91 percent), the winner of the national popular vote has also carried the Electoral College vote. The winners of the nationwide popular vote and the Electoral College vote differ only in close elections. In highly competitive elections, candidates focus on turning out their vote in the contested swing states critical to winning an electoral college majority, so they do not try to maximize their popular vote by real or fraudulent vote increases in one-party areas.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282575990_The_Ten_Most_Competitive_American_Presidential_Elections |title=The Ten Most Competitive American Presidential Elections |first=Douglas Dana |last=Rose |work=ResearchGate }}</ref>

However, candidates can fail to get the most votes in the nationwide popular vote in a presidential election and still win. In the 1824 election, Jackson won the popular vote, but no one received the majority of electoral votes. According to the Twelfth Amendment, the House must choose the president out of the top three people in the election. Clay had come fourth, so he threw his support to Adams, who then won. Because Adams later named Clay his Secretary of State, Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams gained the presidency by making a deal with Clay. Charges of a "corrupt bargain" followed Adams through his term.

Then in [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], the winner of the electoral vote lost the popular vote outright. Numerous [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments]] have been submitted seeking to replace the Electoral College with a direct popular vote, but none has ever successfully passed both Houses of Congress. Another alternate proposal is the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], an [[interstate compact]] whereby individual participating states agree to allocate their electors based on the winner of the national popular vote instead of just their respective statewide results.

The presidential election day was established on a Tuesday in the month of November because of the factors involved (weather, harvests and worship). When voters used to travel to the polls by horse, Tuesday was an ideal day because it allowed people to worship on Sunday, ride to their [[county seat]] on Monday, and vote on Tuesday—all before market day, Wednesday. The month of November also fits nicely between harvest time and harsh winter weather, which could be especially bad to people traveling by [[horse and buggy]].<ref name="election history facts CNN">{{cite web |last=Yan|first=Holly|title=Why Tuesday, why November, why elephants?

Until 1937, presidents were not sworn in until March 4 because it took so long to count and report ballots, and because of the winner's logistical issues in moving to the capital. With improvements in transportation and the passage of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]], presidential inaugurations were moved forward to noon on January 20, thereby allowing presidents to start their duties sooner.<ref name="election history facts CNN"/>

The [[Federal Election Campaign Act|Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971]] was enacted to increase disclosure of [[Campaign finance in the United States|contributions for federal campaigns]]. Subsequent amendments to law require that candidates to a federal office must file a Statement of Candidacy with the [[Federal Election Commission]] before they can receive contributions aggregating in excess of $5,000 or make expenditures aggregating in excess of $5,000. Thus, this began a trend of presidential candidates declaring their intentions to run as early as the Spring of the previous calendar year so they can start raising and spending the money needed for their nationwide campaign.<ref name="WAPOST20150403" />

The first president, [[George Washington]], was elected as an [[Independent politician|independent]]. Since the election of his successor, [[John Adams]], in [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]], all winners of U.S. presidential elections have represented one of two major parties. [[Third party (United States)|Third parties]] have taken second place only twice, in [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] and [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]]. The last time a third (independent) candidate achieved significant success (although still finishing in third place) was [[Ross Perot]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], and the last time a third-party candidate received any electoral votes not from [[faithless elector]]s was [[George Wallace]] in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]].
