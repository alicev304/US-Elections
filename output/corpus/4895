He grew up in a home with his mother and his stepfather, CBS News President Bill Leonard.[8] He did not develop a relationship with his biological father until the age of 14.[9] Leonard gave him early exposure to political journalism, hiring him as an assistant to Walter Cronkite at the 1964 Republican National Convention. Wallace as a reporter for WBBM-TV, 1975 Wallace attended the Hotchkiss School and Harvard College.[10] He first reported news on-air for WHRB, the student radio station at Harvard. He memorably covered the 1969 student occupation of University Hall and was detained by Cambridge police, using his one phone call to sign off a report from Cambridge City Jail with "This is Chris Wallace in custody."[11] Journalism career[edit] Early career[edit] Although accepted at Yale Law School, Wallace instead took a job with The Boston Globe.[12] He says he realized he wanted to move to television when he noticed all the reporters at the 1972 political conventions were watching the proceedings on TV instead of in person. For a time in the early 1970s, he worked for the Chicago station WBBM-TV, which was owned and operated by CBS.[13] NBC News (1975–1988)[edit] Nightly News and Meet the Press[edit] Wallace began his network journalism career with NBC in 1975, where he stayed for 14 years, as a reporter with WNBC-TV in New York City. Wallace then transferred to NBC's Washington bureau as a political correspondent for NBC News and later served as Washington co-anchor and news reader for the Today show with Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley in 1982. That same year, he also served as chief White House correspondent (1982–1989), anchor of the Sunday edition of NBC Nightly News (1982–1984, 1986–1987), and moderator of Meet the Press (1987–1988). Some journalists have described Wallace's style as confrontational. During President Ronald Reagan's news conference in March 1987, when Reagan admitted to dealing arms for hostages, Wallace asked Reagan why he had denied that Israel was involved with the arms sales to Iran "when you knew that wasn't true."[14] ABC News (1989–2003)[edit] Primetime Thursday and Nightline[edit] Wallace left NBC in 1989 for ABC. Sam Donaldson, ABC's outgoing chief White House correspondent, said he was 'delighted' and 'very pleased' that Wallace, his journalistic rival, will be joining the network saying, 'I've always liked his work, I think he's going to be a plus.'[15] At ABC News, Wallace was the senior correspondent for Primetime Thursday and occasionally hosted Nightline. During the first Gulf War in 1991, he reported from Tel Aviv on the Iraqi Scud missiles attacks. At the time, the Israeli government did not want to advertise where the Scuds landed, to prevent the Iraqis from making adjustments to their launchers. On one episode of Nightline, Wallace started describing the location in Tel Aviv where a Scud missile landed. Host Ted Koppel cut him off and asked him to point to a general area rather than give a specific location.[16] Wallace received a News and Documentary Emmy Award nomination for his reporting on Primetime Live segment: Hope Sells.[17] Wallace interviews Maryland governor Larry Hogan in 2015 Fox News (2003–present)[edit] Fox News Sunday[edit] After another 14 years at ABC, Wallace left in 2003 to join Fox News. Wallace began hosting Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace in 2003 after replacing Tony Snow. Wallace along with Shepard Smith gained a reputation at FOX for their reputable status as journalists on the network.[18][19] In an interview with The Chicago Tribune, Howard Kurtz wrote, "Fox seems to be inching toward more conventional journalism." When asked about his political opinions, Wallace stated, "But I vote for the person, and I've voted for Republicans and Democrats and independents over the course of my life. I feel very strongly that you try not to let that affect the way you report the news."[19] Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes called Wallace "one of the best interviewers in the business. ... I have no idea what he thinks personally, but he asks tough questions of everybody."[19] Throughout his 15 years at FOX, Wallace has participated in coverage of nearly every major political event and has also secured several high-profile interviews with dignitaries and U.S leaders. In February 2009, He secured Fox’s first interview with President Barack Obama.[20] In 2017, he interviewed President Donald Trump for his first interview since being elected. Third presidential debate (2016)[edit] The Commission on Presidential Debates selected Chris Wallace as moderator of the third presidential debate, held on October 19, 2016, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. This was the first time a Fox News anchor had moderated a general election presidential debate.[21] After he was selected, Wallace controversially said, "it's not my job" to fact-check candidates, but that it was the job of the opposing candidate.[22] He received notable praise from both sides of the aisle for his tough questioning of both presidential candidates at that last presidential debate of the 2016 election. Afterwards, Jennifer Rubin in The Washington Post said that, despite her strong disapproval of other Fox News commentators, "No one could watch the final debate and deny that Chris Wallace is among the best in the business."[23] Interview with Vladimir Putin (2018)[edit] In July 2018, Wallace conducted a tough interview with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Wallace questioned Putin about why so many of his political opponents end up dead and, in a notable exchange, sought to hand Putin papers containing the indictment of 12 Russian agents for interference in the 2016 election. (Putin declined to touch the papers.)[24][25] According to The Washington Post's Aaron Blake, Putin was "clearly frustrated by a journalist actually challenging him".[24] His interview earned himself a News and Documentary Emmy Award award for Outstanding Live Interview.[26] This would be the first News and Documentary Award in Fox News' history.[27] Accolades and honors[edit] 1993: The Dupont-Columbia Silver Baton for Excellence in Television Journalism 2011: National Press Foundation Award[28] 2012: The Sol Taishoff Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism, National Press Foundation[29] 2013: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association[30] 2017: Founders Award for Excellence in Journalism, International Center for Journalists (ICFJ)[31] 2018: "Tex" McCrary Journalism Award, Congressional Medal of Honor Society[32] 2018: "The Freedom of Speech Award", Media Institute[33] Personal life[edit] Wallace has said that despite his blood relationship with his father, Mike, his stepfather, Bill Leonard, had far more of an impact on his life. Wallace said that Leonard was "the single most important person in my life."[34] Wallace first developed a relationship with his father in his teens, after his older brother Peter died in 1962 climbing a mountain in Greece.[35] Wallace has been married twice. In 1973, he married Elizabeth Farrell, with whom he has four children: Peter,[36] Megan, Andrew, and Catherine.[37] In 1997, he married Lorraine Smothers (née Martin, born 1959), the former wife of Dick Smothers.[38] Lorraine has two children from her previous marriage: Sarah Smothers and Remick Smothers.[39][40] On October 11, 2006, The Washington Post reported that Wallace had been a registered Democrat for more than two decades. Wallace explained his party affiliation as pragmatism, saying that being a Democrat is the only feasible means of participating in the political process in heavily Democratic Washington, DC. He maintained that he had voted for candidates from both major parties in the past.[41] References[edit] ^ a b Murray, Michael D., ed. (1998). Encyclopedia of Television News. Greenwood. p. 273.
