tail wider closer body big muscle second half narrow toward end report say like use paddle versus stick right just put stick water really go give much advantage ibrahim say paddle end stick everyone ever row boat something like know paddlelike shape make huge difference compete food researcher also learn spinosaurus avoid direct competition big predatory dinosaur land waterloving dinosaur ibrahim
