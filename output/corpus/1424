^ Majority of winning candidate over second placed candidate in terms of electoral college votes. In 1860 the second placed candidate was not second placed in terms of popular votes. ^ Negative numbers indicate winning candidate won absolute majority of electoral college votes but lost the popular vote. ^ 2016 election results are provisional. ^ At the 1872 election the Democratic Party did not field its own candidate but instead supported Liberal Republican Party candidate Horace Greeley. ^ At the 1836 election the Whig Party fielded four candidates - only the leading candidate's (William Henry Harrison) votes are included in the "Republican" columns, the other three Whig candidates votes are included under "Other".
