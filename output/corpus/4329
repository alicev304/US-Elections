The Republican Party did not hold a caucus; Republican presidential delegates were chosen at a party convention on April 2–3.[2][3] However, Democratic Party's primaries in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota were held the same day, as were Republican primaries in the same five states.

Sanders won in the cities of Fargo, Bismarck, and Grand Forks where he had campaigned heavily, and he also swept most other rural, conservative counties in the state. The caucus did not require participants to register before voting due to the state's small population.[4] Analyst for the New York Times Nate Cohn summarized the results: "A Sanders win in North Dakota isn’t much of a surprise. It’s a caucus state and it’s a small state, worth just 18 delegates. He’s won every caucus since Nevada."[5] References[edit] ^ "North Dakota Democratic Party - Official Delegates Allocation".
