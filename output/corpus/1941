cold war plane fly higher faster 55 year first flight still lockheed sr71 design secrecy late 1950 able cruise near edge space outfly missile day hold record highest altitude horizontal flight fastest speed nonrocket power aircraft part family spy plane build venture enemy territory without shoot even detect time satellite drone black paint job design dissipate heat earn nickname blackbird pair sleek line long fuselage make plane look unlike anything come design lose brilliance sr71 blackbird training mission 1997 credit nasahulton archivegetty images still look like something future even though design back 1950s peter merlin aviation historian author design development blackbird say phone interview way fuselage bend wing curve twist look organic mechanical conventional airplane look like someone build one almost look like grow cia spy may 1960 american u2 spy plane shoot duown soviet airspace take aerial photograph initially us government say stray weather research aircraft story fall apart soviet government release photo capture pilot plane surveillance equipment two abandon soviet space shuttle leave kazakh steppe incident immediate diplomatic repercussion cold war reinforce need new type reconnaissance plane fly faster higher safe antiaircraft fire cia want plane fly 90000 foot thereabout high speed invisible radar feasible say merlin task design ambitious machine fall clarence kelly johnson one world greatest aircraft designer secret division engineer lockheed call skunk works everything invent everything recall johnson die 1990 year blackbirds first retire service original plane blackbird family call a12 make maiden flight april 30 1962 total 13 a12 produce plane top secret special access program operate cia 17 blackbird still hold many aviation record 1990 fly coast coast flight los angeles washington 67 minute credit nasa titanium skin aircraft design fly faster 2000 mph friction surround atmosphere heat fuselage point melt conventional airframe plane therefore make titanium metal able withstand high temperature also lighter steel use titanium present problem however first whole new set tool also make titanium fabricate regular steel one shatter brittle titanium contact second source metal prove tricky ussr time greatest supplier titanium world us government purchase lot probably use bogus company say merlin initial aircraft fly completely unpainted show silver titanium skin first paint black 1964 realization black paint efficiently absorb emit heat help lower temperature entire airframe blackbird bear plane different name a12 soon evolve variant design interceptor type fighter aircraft rather surveillance plane effectively mean add airtoair missile second cockpit crew member operate necessary radar equipment new plane look identical a12 except nose call yf12 a12 remain top secret existence yf12 reveal president lyndon johnson 1964 three build operate us air force third variant produce around time call m21 pylon back

cockpit lockheed sr71 credit space frontiersarchive photosgetty images stealth stealth fuselage sr71 include first composite material ever use aircraft make plane harder spot enemy radar essentially stealthy word stealth even use say merlin flying higher altitude antiaircraft fire reach faster missile barely visible radar blackbird enter hostile airspace practically undisturbed idea time enemy detect fire missile already way merlin explain real time datum link take picture film bring film back base process study grumman x29 impossible fighter jet inverted wing result blackbird ever shoot enemy fire however reliability issue 12 32 lose accident also complicated plane operate fly take army people prepare aircraft blackbird operational mission essentially countdown like space mission much preparation involve get crew ready vehicle ready unbelievable amount effort manpower say merlin pilot also suit special way due extreme condition find high altitude basically wear space suit sort thing later see space shuttle crew wear say merlin cockpit also get hot fly high speed much pilot use warm meal long mission press glass blackbirds ever fly soviet airspace something us government stop entirely 1960 incident still play important role cold war perform mission critical theater middle east vietnam north korea sr71 test flight handle nasa credit nasa concordski ever happen soviets
