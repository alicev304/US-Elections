The phrase alludes to the physical draining of swamps to keep mosquito populations low to combat malaria,[1] and Washington D.C. being founded on a supposed swampy ground.[2] It has been used as a metaphor by: Helen Hunt Jackson (1830–1885) who wrote that to "clear the swamp" (the first obvious step to reclaiming "poisonous and swampy wilderness") was an apt metaphor for how to start addressing "the disgrace to us of the present condition of our Indians." [3] Winfield R. Gaylord (1870–1943) to describe the socialist desire to "drain" the "capitalist swamp".[1] Victor L. Berger (1860–1929), who in his book Broadsides referred to changing the capitalist system as "drain[ing] the swamp".[4] A. Philip Randolph (1889–1979) and Bayard Rustin (1912-1987) in A Freedom Budget for All Americans (1966), argued that "The breeding grounds of crime and discontent will be diminished in the same way that draining a swamp cuts down the breeding of mosquitoes, and the causes of discrimination will be considerably reduced." Ronald Reagan, who called to "drain the swamp" of bureaucracy in the federal government in 1983 when commissioning The Grace Commission.[5][6] Jessica Stern in "Preparing for a War on Terrorism" (November 2001), where she calls on the U.S. to see failing and failed states as sources and sanctuaries for terrorists and terrorism (the swamp) and to use foreign aid and soft power to combat them (the draining).[7] Pat Buchanan during his 2000 presidential campaign, when he invoked the saying in opposition to the dominant political parties: "Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp: it's a protected wetland; they breed in it, they spawn in it".[8] Nancy Pelosi in 2006 while announcing her 100-Hour Plan in response to more than a decade of Republican rule.[9][10] Donald Trump to describe his plan to fix problems in the federal government.[1][11] Subsequent protests against the role of Goldman Sachs alumni in his administration also used the metaphor.[12] Traditional Unionist Voice on the front cover of their manifesto for the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election[13] Henry Bolton, the leader of UKIP when referring to its National Executive Committee (NEC) on 22 January 2018.[14] References[edit] ^ a b c Harrington, Rebecca (November 11, 2016).
