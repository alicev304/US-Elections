hypertension diabetesassociated anemia reason may way body adapt live less oxygen research publish thursday american journal physical anthropology find mosuo people live near tibetan plateau central east asia different chronic disease risk possibly due genetic adaptation prevent hypoxia condition body tissue deprive sufficient supply oxygen air ancient human moment fascinating new thing weve learn week ancestor researcher think genetic adaptation might also reduce mosuos risk chronic condition hypertension diabetesassociated anemia study mosuo tibetandescended population living hengduan mountain southwest china elevation 8530 foot researcher learn right despite lifestyle factor ordinarily increase person risk condition mosuo lower risk hypertension diabetesassociated anemia lowaltitude han population read key message look cool highaltitude adaptation effect beyond just highaltitude adaptation expect say coauthor katherine wander assistant professor anthropology binghamton university new york state human biological variation matter chronic disease risk study intersection genetic adaptation chronic disease risk really pretty important people generally just mosuo history builtin protection people live tibetan plateau altitude approximately 17700 foot thousand year report say characteristic seem mitigate hypoxic stress deadly ancient crocodile imitate whale dominate ocean whereas traveler high altitude experience 10 20 drop oxygen uptake rate oxygen use body maximal work tibetan show deficit body naturally dilate blood vessel process call vasodilation compensate reduce oxygen content raise blood supply lower blood pressure enhance oxygen delivery artery characteristic likely lower hypertension study say hypertension may cause underproduction vasodilator help blood flow thicken artery tibetan population also adaptation call blunt erythropoiesis blunt red blood cell production body undergo hypoxic stress mechanism kidney signal excessive amount red blood cell deliver oxygen tissue make really thick blood people diabetes natural process harmful malfunction kidney impaired sensitivity hypoxia impede ability correct
