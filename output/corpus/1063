C. Claiborne December 20, 1803[a] – July 30, 1812 Thomas Jefferson James Madison Governors of the State of Louisiana[edit] Louisiana was admitted to the Union on April 30, 1812.[7] It seceded from the Union on January 26, 1861,[8] and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 8, 1861.[9] However, since substantial parts of the state remained in Union hands throughout the war, there were 2 lines of governors elected. Following the end of the American Civil War, Louisiana during Reconstruction was part of the Fifth Military District, which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections.[10] Louisiana was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.[11] The 1812 constitution established the office of governor, to serve for four years[12] starting from the fourth Monday after the election.[13] In 1845, the start date was moved to the fourth Monday of the January after the election;[14] in 1864, it was moved to the second Monday of the January after the election;[15] in 1879 it was moved to the first Monday after the General Assembly announced the election result;[16] and in 1974, it was set to the second Monday of the January following the election.[17]. Governors were not allowed to succeed themselves[18] until 1864, when the constitution held no term limits. The restriction on governors succeeding themselves was reintroduced in 1868,[19] removed again in 1879, and again added in 1898.[20] An amendment to the constitution passed in 1966 allowed governors to succeed themselves once before requiring a gap before they can be elected again.[citation needed] Governors of Louisiana can only serve two consecutive terms, but can serve again after being out of office for one term;[21] more than half of one full four year term is considered a term as well.[21] In the event of a vacancy, the President of the Senate originally acted as governor.[22] The 1845 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, to be elected at the same time and manner as the governor[23] and who would act as governor in the event of a vacancy.[24] The 1913 constitution established that the lieutenant governor would become governor in case of a vacancy.[25] The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on a ticket.[26] Governors of the State of Louisiana[b] No. Governor Term in office Party Election Lt.

It is not known why this occurred.[28] ^ Robertson resigned to take a joint seat on the United States District Court for both the Eastern and Western Districts of Louisiana.[29] ^ Sources disagree on why Beauvais' term ended; some say he lost his bid to be reelected as senate president,[30] while others say he resigned so that he could run for governor.[31] ^ Special election called due to the death of Pierre Derbigny and the succession crisis that followed.[32] ^ The 1845 constitution adjusted the election schedule, shortening this term to three years. ^ The 1845 constitution provided that the first governor elected under it "shall be duly installed in office during the first week of their session", explaining the off-schedule commencement date of Thursday, February 12.[34] ^ While all sources state Walker resigned due to objections to the 1852 constitution,[35][36][37] there is no mention made of Hébert taking office early; it's possible that Walker's resignation was a symbolic one of protest on his last day, or that it was so close to the end of the term that Hébert simply took office then. No known source elaborates. ^ The 1852 constitution adjusted the election schedule, shortening this term to three years. ^ The 1852 constitution provided that the first governor elected under it "shall be duly installed in office during the first week of the session", explaining the off-schedule commencement date of Tuesday, January 18.[38] ^ Most sources state Wickliffe took office on January 22[39] or January 30;[40] however, contemporary news coverage indicates it happened on Monday, January 28.[41] ^ a b c d e The area around New Orleans was captured by the Union on April 25, 1862. The control was enough that it operated within the United States as the legitimate state of Louisiana, electing members to the United States House of Representatives. With both governments being considered legitimate, both lines are included in all lists of governors. The schism ended when the Confederate governor fled and the whole state came under Union control. ^ Shepley was appointed military governor by General Benjamin Butler.[42] ^ Allen fled to Mexico to avoid capture following the American Civil War.[43] ^ Hahn resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate; however, congressmen from the Confederate states were denied their seats in the 39th United States Congress.[44] ^ Wells was removed from office by General Philip Sheridan for failing to properly implement Reconstruction reforms.[45] ^ Represented the Democratic Party ^ Thomas J. Durant was appointed to replace Wells,[46] but declined the appointment.[47] Flanders was then appointed on June 6 by General Philip Sheridan.[47] ^ Flanders resigned due to Major General Winfield Scott Hancock's removing Radical Republicans that Flanders had appointed to positions in state government.[48] ^ Baker was appointed by General Winfield Scott Hancock on January 2 to replace Benjamin Flanders,[49] though he would not take the oath of office until January 8.[50] ^ Baker was removed from office by General Ulysses S. Grant.[51] ^ During the 1872 election, Warmoth endorsed John McEnery for governor, and the State Returning Board, which he appointed, declared McEnery the winner. However, a rival board declared William Pitt Kellogg the winner, and the legislature impeached Warmoth on charges related to the election. Impeached officials are suspended from office, so at this time, P. B. S. Pinchback filled the office. The term expired only 35 days later, at which point impeachment charges were dropped, as Warmoth was no longer governor. ^ a b The State Election Board certified McEnery as the winner of the 1872 election; however, a rival board declared Kellogg the winner, and the legislature went with that. Both McEnery and Kellogg declared victory and formed governments, and conflict culminated in the Battle of Liberty Place and the Colfax massacre. President Ulysses S. Grant issued a proclamation on May 22, 1873, declaring Kellogg the winner.[52][53] ^ a b Much like the 1872 election, this election was disputed. Both Packard and Nicholls declared victory and formed governments, until President Rutherford B. Hayes recognized Nicholls as governor in the Compromise of 1877.[54] ^ The 1879 constitution adjusted the election schedule, shortening this term to three years. ^ Sources say Wiltz took office on January 14; however, this was not a Monday, as specified in the constitution. It is not known why this occurred.[55] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Nicholls took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 21, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Foster took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 16, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Heard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 21, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 16, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 18, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 20, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 15, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 17, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ Sources are not in agreement on when Blanchard took office; the constitutional start date would have been May 19, and several contemporary news sources say he was inaugurated that day.[citation needed] ^ a b Long was elected to the United States Senate for a term beginning March 4, 1931; however, he did not take the seat until January 25, 1932. This was in part to prevent Lieutenant Governor Cyr from replacing him as governor. When the senate term began, Cyr took the oath of office as governor and claimed the office; however, Long called this illegitimate, and said that by taking the oath of office of the governor, he had resigned from being lieutenant governor. This opened the way for the president pro tempore of the senate, Alvin Olin King, to become lieutenant governor, and ultimately succeed Long. Cyr continued to claim the office of governor on and off until 1932, but ultimately lacked recognition.[56][57] ^ Leche resigned due to a scandal involving mail fraud.[58] ^ Edwards's second term began on January 13, 2020, and will expire on January 2024.
