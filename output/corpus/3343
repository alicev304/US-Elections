Democrats appear to have taken a Republican-held House seat, giving them seven of Maryland’s eight districts. And Senator Barack Obama carried the state by a far wider margin than any Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. A fight within the Republican Party created the opening for a Democratic gain. In the Republican primary, Representative Wayne T. Gilchrest lost to a more conservative opponent, State Senator Andy Harris, setting up a general election without an incumbent. With all precincts reporting, the Democrat, Frank M. Kratovil Jr., the state’s attorney for Queen Anne’s County, led Mr. Harris by fewer than 1,000 votes. Marylanders easily approved ballot measures to allow early voting and video lottery terminals.
