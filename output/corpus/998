Democrats held 45 seats after the 2018 elections, while independents caucusing with the Democratic Party held two seats.[8] Including the special elections in Arizona and Georgia, Republicans will be defending 23 seats in 2020, while the Democratic Party will be defending 12 seats.[9] Democrats will need to pick up three or four seats to gain a majority in the Senate, depending on which party wins control of the vice presidency.[a][10] Contents 1 Partisan composition 1.1 Before the elections 1.2 After the elections 2 Predictions 3 Election dates 4 Race summary 4.1 Overview 4.2 Special elections during the preceding Congress 4.3 Elections leading to the next Congress 5 Alabama 6 Alaska 7 Arizona (Special) 8 Arkansas 9 Colorado 10 Delaware 11 Georgia 12 Georgia (Special) 13 Idaho 14 Illinois 15 Iowa 16 Kansas 17 Kentucky 18 Louisiana 19 Maine 20 Massachusetts 21 Michigan 22 Minnesota 23 Mississippi 24 Montana 25 Nebraska 26 New Hampshire 27 New Jersey 28 New Mexico 29 North Carolina 30 Oklahoma 31 Oregon 32 Rhode Island 33 South Carolina 34 South Dakota 35 Tennessee 36 Texas 37 Virginia 38 West Virginia 39 Wyoming 40 See also 41 Notes 42 References Partisan composition[edit] Republicans are expected to defend 23 seats in 2020, while the Democratic Party is expected to defend only 12 seats.[9] Each block represents one of the one hundred seats in the U.S. Senate. "D#" is a Democratic senator, "I#" is an Independent senator, and "R#" is a Republican senator. They are arranged so that the parties are separated and a majority is clear by crossing the middle. Before the elections[edit] Each block indicates an incumbent senator's actions going into the election. Both independents caucus with the Democrats.

Defeated in the primary were 2017 Republican nominee Roy Moore, evangelist Stanley Adair,[77] Congressman Bradley Byrne,[78] state representative Arnold Mooney,[79] and community activist Ruth Page Nelson.[80] Secretary of State John Merrill was also a candidate[81] but suspended his campaign prior to the primary.[82] Alaska[edit] Main article: 2020 United States Senate election in Alaska See also: List of United States senators from Alaska One-term incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan was elected to a first term in 2014, defeating incumbent Democratic senator Mark Begich.
