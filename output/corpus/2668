The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded ONDCP’s mission to include assessing budgets and resources related to the National Drug Control Strategy. Executive Orders 12880 (1993), 12992 (1996) and 13023 (1996) tasked ONDCP with the responsibility to lead the United States’ drug-control policy and reiterated that ONDCP’s Director is the Executive Branch’s senior drug control policy official. The Drug Free Communities Act of 1997 authorized ONDCP to carry out a national initiative that awards Federal grants directly to community coalitions. The Media Campaign Act of 1998 directed ONDCP to conduct a national media campaign for the purpose of reducing and preventing drug use among young people in the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 expanded ONDCP’s mandate and authority, including: Development of a long-term national drug control strategy; Implementation of a robust performance-measurement system; Commitment to a five-year national drug-control program budget; Permanent authority for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas grant program; Increased reporting to Congress on drug-control activities; Reorganization of ONDCP to allow more effective national leadership; and Improved coordination among national drug-control program agencies. Executive Order 13165 (2000) created the White House Task Force on Drug Use in Sports. It authorized the Director of ONDCP to serve as the U.S. Government’s representative on the board of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 reauthorized ONDCP through FY 2010 and expanded the mandate of the Agency, including: Statutorily creating the position of the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator (USIC) and the Interdiction Committee (TIC) within ONDCP; Adding faith-based organizations and tribal officials to the National Drug Control Strategy consultation list; and Establishing a HIDTA designation petition process. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act was signed into law by President Trump in October 2018. The SUPPORT Act reauthorized ONDCP through FY 2023, expanded ONDCP’s mandate, and made other changes, including: Reauthorizing the HIDTA and Drug Free Communities grant programs at ONDCP; Creating an Emerging Threats Committee tasked with proactively identifying and preparing for the next drug crises; Allowing a portion of HIDTA funds to be used for prevention and treatment; Creating an online Drug Control Data Dashboard with search functions; Creating a Grant Tracking System to better track and improve federal drug grants; and Creating a cadre of coordinators at ONDCP to lead efforts on key drug issues.
