Senate Governor House Districts State Highlights The Republican wave barely touched this increasingly Democratic state, where voters re-elected a Democratic senator and governor. The party’s only major gain was in recapturing a historically Republican House seat that it barely lost two years ago. In that district, which covers the state’s Eastern Shore, State Senator Andy Harris defeated Representative Frank Kratovil Jr., who beat him in 2008. Democrats won six of the state’s eight House seats. In another rematch, Gov. Martin O’Malley defeated Robert L. Ehrlich Jr., the Republican he ousted in 2006. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski won a sweeping victory over Eric Wargotz, a Queen Anne’s County commissioner, gaining her fifth term. In January, she will become the longest-serving woman in the history of the Senate.
