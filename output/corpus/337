It is bordered by six states: Wisconsin to the northeast, Illinois to the east and southeast, Missouri to the south, Nebraska to the west, South Dakota to the northwest, and Minnesota to the north. In colonial times, Iowa was a part of French Louisiana and Spanish Louisiana; its state flag is patterned after the flag of France. After the Louisiana Purchase, people laid the foundation for an agriculture-based economy in the heart of the Corn Belt.[8] In the latter half of the 20th century, Iowa's agricultural economy made the transition to a diversified economy of advanced manufacturing, processing, financial services, information technology, biotechnology, and green energy production.[9][10] Iowa is the 26th most extensive in land area and the 30th most populous of the 50 U.S. states. The state's capital, most populous city, and largest metropolitan area fully located within the state is Des Moines. A portion of the larger Omaha, Nebraska, metropolitan area extends into three counties of southwest Iowa.[11] Iowa has been listed as one of the safest U.S. states to live in.[12] Contents 1 Etymology 2 Geography 2.1 Boundaries 2.2 Geology and terrain 2.3 Ecology and environment 3 Climate 4 Prehistory 5 History 5.1 Early colonization, exploitation and trade, 1673–1808 5.2 War of 1812 and unstable U.S. control 5.3 Indian removal, 1814–1832 5.4 U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832–1860 5.5 Civil War, 1861–1865 5.6 Agricultural expansion, 1865–1930 5.7 Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985 5.8 Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present 6 Demographics 6.1 Population 6.2 Settlement 6.3 Birth data 6.4 Religion 6.5 Language 7 Attractions 7.1 Central Iowa 7.2 Eastern Iowa 7.3 Western Iowa 7.4 Northeast and Northern Iowa 7.5 Statewide 8 Economy 8.1 Manufacturing 8.2 Agriculture 8.3 Health insurance 8.4 Other sectors 8.5 Taxation 9 Transportation 9.1 Interstate highways 9.2 Airports with scheduled flights 9.3 Railroads 10 Law and government 10.1 State 10.2 National 10.3 Political parties 10.4 Voter trends 10.5 Presidential caucus 10.6 Civil rights 10.6.1 Racial equality 10.6.2 Women's rights 10.6.3 LGBT rights 11 Sister jurisdictions 12 Education 12.1 Primary and secondary schools 12.2 Colleges and universities 13 Culture 13.1 Arts 13.2 Sports 13.2.1 College sports 13.2.2 Baseball 13.2.3 Ice hockey 13.2.4 Soccer 13.2.5 Other sports 14 Iowans 15 See also 16 Notes 17 References 18 External links Etymology[edit] Iowa derives its name from the Ioway people, one of the many Native American tribes that occupied the state at the time of European colonization.[13] Geography[edit] Main article: Geography of Iowa Boundaries[edit] See also: List of counties in Iowa Topography of Iowa, with counties and major streams Iowa is bordered by the Mississippi River on the east and the Missouri River and the Big Sioux River on the west. The northern boundary is a line along 43 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude.[14][b] The southern border is the Des Moines River and a not-quite-straight line along approximately 40 degrees 35 minutes north, as decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in Missouri v. Iowa (1849) after a standoff between Missouri and Iowa known as the Honey War.[15][16] Iowa is the only state whose east and west borders are formed entirely by rivers.[17] Iowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County.[18] Geology and terrain[edit] DeSoto Lake at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge Fountain Springs Park in Delaware County, Iowa Iowa's bedrock geology generally increases in age from west to east. In northwest Iowa, Cretaceous bedrock can be 74 million years old; in eastern Iowa Cambrian bedrock dates to c. 500 million years ago.[19] Iowa is generally not flat; most of the state consists of rolling hills. Iowa can be divided into eight landforms based on glaciation, soils, topography, and river drainage.[20] Loess hills lie along the western border of the state, some of which are several hundred feet thick.[21] Northeast Iowa along the Upper Mississippi River is part of the Driftless Area, consisting of steep hills and valleys which appear almost mountainous.[22] Several natural lakes exist, most notably Spirit Lake, West Okoboji Lake, and East Okoboji Lake in northwest Iowa (see Iowa Great Lakes). To the east lies Clear Lake. Man-made lakes include Lake Odessa,[23] Saylorville Lake, Lake Red Rock, Coralville Lake, Lake MacBride, and Rathbun Lake. Before European settlement, 4 to 6 million acres of the state was covered with wetlands, about 95% of these wetlands have been drained.[24] Ecology and environment[edit] Main article: Environment of Iowa Landforms of Iowa, based on Prior (1991) Iowa's natural vegetation is tallgrass prairie and savanna in upland areas, with dense forest and wetlands in flood plains and protected river valleys, and pothole wetlands in northern prairie areas.[20] Most of Iowa is used for agriculture; crops cover 60% of the state, grasslands (mostly pasture and hay with some prairie and wetland) cover 30%, and forests cover 7%; urban areas and water cover another 1% each.[25] The southern part of Iowa is categorized as the Central forest-grasslands transition ecoregion.[26] The Northern, drier part of Iowa is categorized as part of the Central tall grasslands.[27] There is a dearth of natural areas in Iowa; less than 1% of the tallgrass prairie that once covered most of Iowa remains intact; only about 5% of the state's prairie pothole wetlands remain, and most of the original forest has been lost.[28] As of 2005[update] Iowa ranked 49th of U.S. states in public land holdings.[29] Threatened or endangered animals in Iowa include the interior least tern, piping plover, Indiana bat, pallid sturgeon, the Iowa Pleistocene land snail, Higgins' eye pearly mussel, and the Topeka shiner.[30] Endangered or threatened plants include western prairie fringed orchid, eastern prairie fringed orchid, Mead's milkweed, prairie bush clover, and northern wild monkshood.[31] There is little proof to suggest that the explosion in the number of high-density livestock facilities in Iowa has led to increased rural water contamination and a decline in air quality.[32] In fact, covered manure storage in modern barns prevent that manure from washing away into surface water, as it does in open lots as snow melts and thunderstorms occur. Other factors negatively affecting Iowa's environment include the extensive use of older coal-fired power plants,[33] fertilizer and pesticide runoff from crop production,[34] and diminishment of the Jordan Aquifer.[35] Climate[edit] Köppen climate types in Iowa Iowa annual rainfall, in inches Iowa has a humid continental climate throughout the state (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with extremes of both heat and cold. The average annual temperature at Des Moines is 50 °F (10 °C); for some locations in the north, such as Mason City, the figure is about 45 °F (7 °C), while Keokuk, on the Mississippi River, averages 52 °F (11 °C).[36] Snowfall is common, with Des Moines getting about 26 days of snowfall a year, and other places, such as Shenandoah getting about 11 days of snowfall in a year.[37] Spring ushers in the beginning of the severe weather season. Iowa averages about 50 days of thunderstorm activity per year.[38] The 30-year annual average Tornadoes in Iowa is 47.[39] In 2008, twelve people were killed by tornadoes in Iowa, making it the deadliest year since 1968 and also the second most tornadoes in a year with 105, matching the total from 2001.[40] Iowa summers are known for heat and humidity, with daytime temperatures sometimes near 90 °F (32 °C) and occasionally exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). Average winters in the state have been known to drop well below freezing, even dropping below −18 °F (−28 °C). Iowa's all-time hottest temperature of 118 °F (48 °C) was recorded at Keokuk on July 20, 1934, during a nationwide heat wave;[41] the all-time lowest temperature of −47 °F (−44 °C) was recorded at Washta on February 3, 1996.[42] Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Iowa cities (°F)[43] City Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Davenport[44] 30/13 36/19 48/29 61/41 72/52 81/63 85/68 83/66 76/57 65/45 48/32 35/20 Des Moines[45] 31/14 36/19 49/30 62/41 72/52 82/62 86/67 84/65 76/55 63/43 48/31 34/18 Keokuk[46] 34/17 39/21 50/30 63/42 73/52 83/62 87/67 85/65 78/56 66/44 51/33 33/21 Mason City[47] 24/6 29/12 41/23 57/35 69/46 79/57 82/61 80/58 73/49 60/37 43/25 28/11 Sioux City[48] 31/10 35/15 47/26 62/37 73/49 82/59 86/63 83/63 76/51 63/38 46/25 32/13 Iowa has a relatively smooth gradient of varying precipitation across the state, with areas in the southeast of the state receiving an average of over 38 inches (97 cm) of rain annually, and the northwest of the state receiving less than 28 inches (71 cm).[49] The pattern of precipitation across Iowa is seasonal, with more rain falling in the summer months. Virtually statewide, the driest month is January or February, and the wettest month is June, owing to frequent showers and thunderstorms, some of which produce hail, damaging winds and/or tornadoes. In Des Moines, roughly in the center of the state, over two-thirds of the 34.72 inches (88.2 cm) of rain falls from April through September, and about half the average annual precipitation falls from May through August, peaking in June.[50] Prehistory[edit] Main articles: Iowa archaeology and Indians of Iowa Excavation of the 3,800-year-old Edgewater Park Site When American Indians first arrived in what is now Iowa more than 13,000 years ago, they were hunters and gatherers living in a Pleistocene glacial landscape. By the time European explorers and traders visited Iowa, American Indians were largely settled farmers with complex economic, social, and political systems. This transformation happened gradually. During the Archaic period (10,500 to 2,800 years ago), American Indians adapted to local environments and ecosystems, slowly becoming more sedentary as populations increased.[51] More than 3,000 years ago, during the Late Archaic period, American Indians in Iowa began utilizing domesticated plants. The subsequent Woodland period saw an increased reliance on agriculture and social complexity, with increased use of mounds, ceramics, and specialized subsistence. During the Late Prehistoric period (beginning about AD 900) increased use of maize and social changes led to social flourishing and nucleated settlements.[51] The arrival of European trade goods and diseases in the Protohistoric period led to dramatic population shifts and economic and social upheaval, with the arrival of new tribes and early European explorers and traders. There were numerous Indian tribes living in Iowa at the time of early European exploration. Tribes which were probably descendants of the prehistoric Oneota include the Dakota, Ho-Chunk, Ioway, and Otoe. Tribes which arrived in Iowa in the late prehistoric or protohistoric periods include the Illiniwek, Meskwaki, Omaha, and Sauk.[51] History[edit] Main article: History of Iowa Early colonization, exploitation and trade, 1673–1808[edit] Main articles: New France, Louisiana (New France), French and Indian War, Treaty of Paris (1763), New Spain, Louisiana (New Spain), Treaty of Aranjuez (1801), Louisiana Purchase, District of Louisiana, and Louisiana Territory Iowa in 1718 with the modern state area highlighted The first known European explorers to document Iowa were Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet who traveled the Mississippi River in 1673 documenting several Indian villages on the Iowa side.[52][53] The area of Iowa was claimed for France and remained a French territory until 1763. The French, before their impending defeat in the French and Indian War, transferred ownership to their ally, Spain.[54] Spain practiced very loose control over the Iowa region, granting trading licenses to French and British traders, who established trading posts along the Mississippi and Des Moines Rivers.[52] Iowa was part of a territory known as La Louisiane or Louisiana, and European traders were interested in lead and furs obtained by Indians. The Sauk and Meskwaki effectively controlled trade on the Mississippi in the late 18th century and early 19th century. Among the early traders on the Mississippi were Julien Dubuque, Robert La Salle, and Paul Marin.[52] Along the Missouri River at least five French and English trading houses were built before 1808.[55] In 1800, Napoleon Bonaparte took control of Louisiana from Spain in a treaty.[56] After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Congress divided the Louisiana Purchase into two parts—the Territory of Orleans and the District of Louisiana, with present-day Iowa falling in the latter. The Indiana Territory was created in 1800 to exercise jurisdiction over this portion of the District; William Henry Harrison was its first governor. Much of Iowa was mapped by Zebulon Pike in 1805,[57] but it was not until the construction of Fort Madison in 1808 that the U.S. established tenuous military control over the region.[58] Plan of Fort Madison, 1810 War of 1812 and unstable U.S. control[edit] Main article: Missouri Territory Fort Madison was built to control trade and establish U.S. dominance over the Upper Mississippi, but it was poorly designed and disliked by the Sauk and Ho-Chunk, many of whom allied with the British, who had not abandoned claims to the territory.[58][59] Fort Madison was defeated by British-supported Indians in 1813 during the War of 1812, and Fort Shelby in Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, also fell to the British. Black Hawk took part in the siege of Fort Madison.[60][61] After the war, the U.S. re-established control of the region through the construction of Fort Armstrong, Fort Snelling in Minnesota, and Fort Atkinson in Nebraska.[62] Indian removal, 1814–1832[edit] See also: Indian removal A map of Iowa Indian Territory Accessions The U.S. encouraged settlement of the east side of the Mississippi and removal of Indians to the west.[63] A disputed 1804 treaty between Quashquame and William Henry Harrison that surrendered much of Illinois to the U.S. enraged many Sauk and led to the 1832 Black Hawk War.[64] The Sauk and Meskwaki sold their land in the Mississippi Valley during 1832 in the Black Hawk Purchase[65] and sold their remaining land in Iowa in 1842, most of them moving to a reservation in Kansas.[64] Many Meskwaki later returned to Iowa and settled near Tama, Iowa; the Meskwaki Settlement remains to this day. In 1856 the Iowa Legislature passed an unprecedented act allowing the Meskawki to purchase the land.[66] The Ho-Chunk were removed from Iowa in 1848,[67] and the Dakota were removed by 1858.[68] Western Iowa around modern Council Bluffs was used as an Indian Reservation for members of the Council of Three Fires.[69] U.S. settlement and statehood, 1832–1860[edit] Main articles: Michigan Territory, Wisconsin Territory, Organic act § List of organic acts, Iowa Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union Iowa Territorial Seal The first American settlers officially moved to Iowa in June 1833.[70] Primarily, they were families from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Indiana, Kentucky, and Virginia who settled along the western banks of the Mississippi River, founding the modern day cities of Dubuque and Bellevue.[70][71] On July 4, 1838, the U.S. Congress established the Territory of Iowa. President Martin Van Buren appointed Robert Lucas governor of the territory, which at the time had 22 counties and a population of 23,242.[72] Almost immediately after achieving territorial status, a clamor arose for statehood. On December 28, 1846, Iowa became the 29th state in the Union when President James K. Polk signed Iowa's admission bill into law. Once admitted to the Union, the state's boundary issues resolved, and most of its land purchased from the Indians, Iowa set its direction to development and organized campaigns for settlers and investors, boasting the young frontier state's rich farmlands, fine citizens, free and open society, and good government.[73] Iowa has a long tradition of state and county fairs. The first and second Iowa State Fairs were held in the more developed eastern part of the state at Fairfield. The first fair was held October 25–27, 1854, at a cost of around $323. Thereafter, the fair moved to locations closer to the center of the state and in 1886 found a permanent home in Des Moines. The State Fair has been held every year since except for the year 1898 due to the Spanish–American War and the World's Fair being held in nearby Omaha, Nebraska. The fair was also a World War II wartime casualty from 1942 to 1945, as the fairgrounds were being used as an army supply depot.[74] Civil War, 1861–1865[edit] Jane and Samuel Kirkwood, 1852 Iowa supported the Union during the Civil War, voting heavily for Abraham Lincoln, though there was an antiwar "Copperhead" movement in the state, caused partially by a drop in crop prices caused by the war.[75] There were no battles in the state, although the battle of Athens, Missouri, 1861, was fought just across the Des Moines River from Croton, Iowa, and shots from the battle landed in Iowa. Iowa sent large supplies of food to the armies and the eastern cities.[76] Much of Iowa's support for the Union can be attributed to Samuel J. Kirkwood, its first wartime governor. Of a total population of 675,000, about 116,000 men were subjected to military duty. Iowa contributed proportionately more men to Civil War military service than did any other state, north or south, sending more than 75,000 volunteers to the armed forces, over one-sixth of whom were killed before the Confederates surrendered at Appomattox.[76] Most fought in the great campaigns in the Mississippi Valley and in the South.[77] Iowa troops fought at Wilson's Creek in Missouri, Pea Ridge in Arkansas, Forts Henry and Donelson, Shiloh, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, and Rossville Gap as well as Vicksburg, Iuka, and Corinth. They served with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and fought under Union General Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley. Many died and were buried at Andersonville. They marched on General Nathaniel Banks' ill-starred expedition to the Red River. Twenty-seven Iowans have been awarded the Medal of Honor, the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government, which was first awarded in the Civil War.[78] Iowa had several brigadier generals and four major generals—Grenville Mellen Dodge, Samuel R. Curtis, Francis J. Herron, and Frederick Steele—and saw many of its generals go on to state and national prominence following the war.[76] Agricultural expansion, 1865–1930[edit] Iowa farm, 1875 Following the Civil War, Iowa's population continued to grow dramatically, from 674,913 people in 1860[79] to 1,624,615 in 1880.[80] The American Civil War briefly brought higher profits.[81] In 1917, the United States entered World War I and farmers as well as all Iowans experienced a wartime economy. For farmers, the change was significant. Since the beginning of the war in 1914, Iowa farmers had experienced economic prosperity, which lasted until the end of the war.[81] In the economic sector, Iowa also has undergone considerable change. Beginning with the first industries developed in the 1830s,[82] which were mainly for processing materials grown in the area,[83] Iowa has experienced a gradual increase in the number of business and manufacturing operations. Depression, World War II and manufacturing, 1930–1985[edit] The transition from an agricultural economy to a mixed economy happened slowly. The Great Depression and World War II accelerated the shift away from smallholder farming to larger farms, and began a trend of urbanization. The period after World War II witnessed a particular increase in manufacturing operations.[84] The farm crisis of the 1980s caused a major recession in Iowa, causing poverty not seen since the Depression.[85] The crisis spurred a major, decade-long population decline.[86] Reemergence as a mixed economy, 1985–present[edit] After bottoming out in the 1980s, Iowa's economy began to become increasingly less dependent on agriculture, and by the early 21st century was characterized by a mix of manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services.[87] The population of Iowa has increased at a faster rate than the U.S. as a whole,[86] and Iowa now has a predominantly urban population.[88] The Iowa Economic Development Authority, created in 2011 has replaced the Iowa Department of Economic Development and its annual reports are a source of economic information.[89] Demographics[edit] Population[edit] Historical population Census Pop. %± 1840 43,112 — 1850 192,214 345.8% 1860 674,913 251.1% 1870 1,194,020 76.9% 1880 1,624,615 36.1% 1890 1,912,297 17.7% 1900 2,231,853 16.7% 1910 2,224,771 −0.3% 1920 2,404,021 8.1% 1930 2,470,939 2.8% 1940 2,538,268 2.7% 1950 2,621,073 3.3% 1960 2,757,537 5.2% 1970 2,824,376 2.4% 1980 2,913,808 3.2% 1990 2,776,755 −4.7% 2000 2,926,324 5.4% 2010 3,046,355 4.1% Est. 2019 3,155,070 3.6% Source: 1910–2010[90] 2018 estimate[91] The United States Census Bureau estimates the population of Iowa was 3,155,070 on July 1, 2019, a 3.57% increase since the 2010 Census.[91] Of the residents of Iowa, 70.8% were born in Iowa, 23.6% were born in a different U.S. state, 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas, or born abroad to American parent(s), and 5% were foreign born.[92] Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 29,386 people, while migration within the country produced a net loss of 41,140 people. 6.5% of Iowa's population were reported as under the age of five, 22.6% under 18, and 14.7% were 65 or older. Males made up approximately 49.6% of the population.[93] Iowa has banned sanctuary cities.[94] The population density of the state is 52.7 people per square mile.[95] As of the 2010 Census, the center of population of Iowa is in Marshall County, near Melbourne.[96] As of the 2010 Census, the population of Iowa was 3,046,355. The gender makeup of the state was 49.5% male and 50.5% female. 23.9% of the population were under the age of 18; 61.2% were between the ages of 18 and 64; and 14.9% were 65 years of age or older.[97] The table below shows the racial composition of Iowa's population as of 2017.

Dark green counties have gains of more than 5%.[104] Iowa's population is more urban than rural, with 61 percent living in urban areas in 2000, a trend that began in the early 20th century.[88] Urban counties in Iowa grew 8.5% from 2000 to 2008, while rural counties declined by 4.2%.[105] The shift from rural to urban has caused population increases in more urbanized counties such as Dallas, Johnson, Linn, Polk, and Scott, at the expense of more rural counties.[106] Iowa, in common with other Midwestern states (especially Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota), is feeling the brunt of rural flight, although Iowa has been gaining population since approximately 1990. Some smaller communities, such as Denison and Storm Lake, have mitigated this population loss through gains in immigrant laborers.[107] Another demographic problem for Iowa is the brain drain, in which educated young adults leave the state in search of better prospects in higher education or employment. During the 1990s, Iowa had the second highest exodus rate for single, educated young adults, second only to North Dakota.[108] See also: List of cities in Iowa and List of largest Iowa cities by population Iowa's largest cities and their surrounding areas Recorded by the United States Census Bureau Rank City 2018 city population[109] 2010 city population[110] Change Metropolitan Statistical Area 2018 metro population[111] 2010 metro population 2018 metro change 1 Des Moines 216,853 203,433 +6.60% Des Moines–West Des Moines 655,409 569,633 +15.06% 2 Cedar Rapids 133,174 126,326 +5.42% Cedar Rapids 272,295 257,940 +5.57% 3 Davenport 102,085 99,685 +2.41% Quad Cities 381,451 379,090 +0.62% 4 Sioux City 82,396 82,684 −0.35% Sioux City 169,045 168,563 +0.29% 5 Iowa City 76,290 67,862 +12.42% Iowa City 173,401 152,586 +13.64% 6 Waterloo 67,798 68,406 −0.89% Waterloo–Cedar Falls 169,659 167,819 +1.10% 7 Ames 67,154 58,965 +13.89% Ames 98,105 89,542 +9.56% 8 West Des Moines 66,641 56,609 +17.72% Des Moines–West Des Moines 655,409 9 Ankeny 65,284 45,582 +43.22% Des Moines–West Des Moines 655,409 10 Council Bluffs 62,421 62,230 +0.31% Omaha–Council Bluffs 942,198 865,350 +8.88% 11 Dubuque 57,941 57,637 +0.53% Dubuque 96,854 93,653 +3.42% 12 Urbandale 43,949 39,463 +11.37% Des Moines–West Des Moines 655,409 13 Cedar Falls 41,048 39,260 +4.55% Waterloo–Cedar Falls 169,659 14 Marion 39,979 34,768 +14.99% Cedar Rapids 272,295 15 Bettendorf 36,543 33,217 +10.01% Quad Cities 381,451 Birth data[edit] Population age comparison between rural Pocahontas County and urban Polk County, illustrating the flight of young adults (red) to urban centers in Iowa[112] Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.

Religion[edit] Amana Colonies were founded by German Pietists. Religion in Iowa (2014)[119] religion percent Protestant   60% No religion   21% Catholic   18% Muslim   1% No answer   1% A 2001 survey from the City University of New York found 52% of Iowans are Protestant, while 23% are Catholic, and other religions made up 6%. 13% responded with non-religious, and 5% did not answer.[120] A survey from the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) in 2010 found that the largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 235,190 adherents and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 229,557. The largest non-Protestant religion was Catholicism with 503,080 adherents. The state has a great number of Reformed denominations. The Presbyterian Church (USA) had almost 290 congregations and 51,380 members followed by the Reformed Church in America with 80 churches and 40,000 members, and the United Church of Christ had 180 churches and 39,000 members.[121] The study Religious Congregations & Membership: 2000[122] found in the southernmost two tiers of Iowa counties and in other counties in the center of the state, the largest religious group was the United Methodist Church; in the northeast part of the state, including Dubuque and Linn counties (where Cedar Rapids is located), the Catholic Church was the largest; and in ten counties, including three in the northern tier, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America was the largest. The study also found rapid growth in Evangelical Christian denominations. Dubuque is home to the Archdiocese of Dubuque, which serves as the ecclesiastical province for all three other dioceses in the state and for all the Catholics in the entire state of Iowa. Historically, religious sects and orders who desired to live apart from the rest of society established themselves in Iowa, such as the Amish and Mennonite near Kalona and in other parts of eastern Iowa such as Davis County and Buchanan County.[123] Other religious sects and orders living apart include Quakers around West Branch and Le Grand, German Pietists who founded the Amana Colonies, followers of Transcendental Meditation who founded Maharishi Vedic City, and Order of Cistercians of the Strict Observance monks and nuns at the New Melleray and Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbies near Dubuque. As of 2016[update] about 6,000 Jews live in Iowa, with about 3000 of them in Des Moines.[124] Language[edit] English is the most common language in Iowa, used by 94% of the population.[125] William Labov and colleagues, in the monumental Atlas of North American English[126] found the English spoken in Iowa divides into multiple linguistic regions. Natives of northern Iowa—including Sioux City, Fort Dodge, and the Waterloo region—tend to speak the dialect linguists call North Central American English, which is also found in North and South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Natives of central and southern Iowa—including such cities as Council Bluffs, Davenport, Des Moines, and Iowa City—tend to speak the North Midland dialect also found in eastern Nebraska, central Illinois, and central Indiana.[127] Natives of East-Central Iowa—including cities such as Cedar Rapids, Dubuque, and Clinton tend to speak with the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, a dialect that extends from this area and east across the Great Lakes Region.[128] After English, Spanish is the second-most-common language spoken in Iowa, with 120,000 people in Iowa of Hispanic or Latino origin[129] and 47,000 people born in Latin America.[130] The third-most-common language is German, spoken by 17,000 people in Iowa;[125] two notable German dialects used in Iowa include Amana German spoken around the Amana Colonies, and Pennsylvania German, spoken among the Amish in Iowa. The Babel Proclamation of 1918 banned the speaking of German in public. Around Pella, residents of Dutch descent once spoke the Pella Dutch dialect. No other language is spoken by more than 0.5 percent of the Iowa population.[125] The only indigenous language used regularly in Iowa is Meskwaki, used around the Meskwaki Settlement.[131] Attractions[edit] Central Iowa[edit] The Christina Reiman Butterfly Wing at Iowa State University, Ames Ames is the home of Iowa State University, the Iowa State Center, and Reiman Gardens.

Scored in 10 individual categories, Iowa was ranked 1st when it came to the "Cost of Doing Business"; this includes all taxes, utility costs, and other costs associated with doing business. Iowa was also ranked 10th in "Economy", 12th in "Business Friendliness", 16th in "Education", 17th in both "Cost of Living" and "Quality of Life", 20th in "Workforce", 29th in "Technology and Innovation", 32nd in "Transportation" and the lowest ranking was 36th in "Access to Capital".[138] Iowa gross state products by industry, 2006[139] While Iowa is often viewed as a farming state, agriculture is a relatively small portion of the state's diversified economy, with manufacturing, biotechnology, finance and insurance services, and government services contributing substantially to Iowa's economy.[87] This economic diversity has helped Iowa weather the late 2000s recession better than most states, with unemployment substantially lower than the rest of the nation.[140][141] If the economy is measured by gross domestic product, in 2005 Iowa's GDP was about $124 billion.[142] If measured by gross state product, for 2005 it was $113.5 billion.[143] Its per capita income for 2006 was $23,340.[143] On July 2, 2009, Standard & Poor's rated the state of Iowa's credit as AAA (the highest of its credit ratings, held by only 11 U.S. state governments).[144] As of December 2015, the state's unemployment rate is 3.4%.[145] Manufacturing[edit] Manufacturing is the largest sector of Iowa's economy, with $20.8 billion (21%) of Iowa's 2003 gross state product. Major manufacturing sectors include food processing, heavy machinery, and agricultural chemicals. Sixteen percent of Iowa's workforce is dedicated to manufacturing.[87] Food processing is the largest component of manufacturing. Besides processed food, industrial outputs include machinery, electric equipment, chemical products, publishing, and primary metals. Companies with direct or indirect processing facilities in Iowa include ConAgra Foods, Wells Blue Bunny, Barilla, Heinz, Tone's Spices, General Mills, and Quaker Oats. Meatpacker Tyson Foods has 11 locations, second only to its headquarter state Arkansas.[146] Major non-food manufacturing firms with production facilities in Iowa include 3M,[147]Arconic,[148] Amana Corporation,[149] Emerson Electric,[150] The HON Company,[151] SSAB,[152] John Deere,[153] Lennox Manufacturing,[154] Pella Corporation,[155] Procter & Gamble,[156] Vermeer Company,[157] and Winnebago Industries.[158] Agriculture[edit] Harvesting corn in Jones County Farm in rural Northwest Iowa Central Iowa cornfield and dairy in June Though industrial-scale, commodity agriculture predominates in much of the state, Iowa has seen growth in the organic farming sector. Iowa ranks fifth in the nation in total number of organic farms. In 2016, there were approximately 732 organic farms in the state, an increase of about 5% from the previous year, and 103,136 organic acres, an increase of 9,429 from the previous year.[159][160] Iowa has also seen an increase in demand for local, sustainably-grown food. Northeast Iowa, part of the Driftless Area, has led the state in development of its regional food system and grows and consumes more local food than any other region in Iowa.[161][162] Iowa's Driftless Region is also home to the nationally recognized Seed Savers Exchange, a non-profit seed bank housed at an 890-acre heritage farm near Decorah, in the northeast corner of the state.[163][164] The largest nongovernmental seed bank of its kind in the United States, Seed Savers Exchange safeguards more than 20,000 varieties of rare, heirloom seeds.[165] As of 2007, the direct production and sale of conventional agricultural commodities contributed only about 3.5% of Iowa's gross state product.[166] In 2002 the impact of the indirect role of agriculture in Iowa's economy, including agriculture-affiliated business, was calculated at 16.4% in terms of value added and 24.3% in terms of total output. This was lower than the economic impact of non-farm manufacturing, which accounted for 22.4% of total value added and 26.5% of total output.[167] Iowa's main conventional agricultural commodities are hogs, corn, soybeans, oats, cattle, eggs, and dairy products. Iowa is the nation's largest producer of ethanol and corn and some years is the largest grower of soybeans. In 2008, the 92,600 farms in Iowa produced 19% of the nation's corn, 17% of the soybeans, 30% of the hogs, and 14% of the eggs.[168] Mural in Mt. Ayr Post Office, "The Corn Parade" by Orr C. Fischer, commissioned as part of the New Deal[169] As of 2009[update] major Iowa agricultural product processors include Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Inc., Diamond V Mills, and Quaker Oats.[170] Health insurance[edit] As of 2014, there were 16 organizations offering health insurance products in Iowa, per the State of Iowa Insurance Division.[171] Iowa was the 4th out of 10 states with the biggest drop in competition levels of health insurance between 2010 and 2011, per the 2013 annual report on the level of competition in the health insurance industry by the American Medical Association[172] using 2011 data from HealthLeaders-Interstudy, the most comprehensive source of data on enrollment in health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), point-of-service (POS) and consumer-driven health care plans.[173] According to the AMA annual report from 2007 Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield had provided 71% of the state's health insurance.[174] The Iowa Insurance Division "Annual report to the Iowa Governor and the Iowa Legislature" from November 2014 looked at the 95% of health insurers by premium, which are 10 companies. It found Wellmark Inc. to dominate the three health insurance markets it examined (individual, small group and large group) at 52–67%.[175]:2 Wellmark HealthPlan of Iowa and Wellmark Inc had the highest risk-based capital percentages of all 10 providers at 1158% and 1132%, respectively.[175]:31 Rising RBC is an indication of profits.[175]:31 Other sectors[edit] Ethanol plant under construction in Butler County Wind turbines near Williams Iowa has a strong financial and insurance sector, with approximately 6,100 firms,[87] including AEGON, Nationwide Group, Aviva USA, Farm Bureau Financial Services, Voya Financial, Marsh Affinity Group, MetLife, Principal Financial Group, Principal Capital Management, Wells Fargo, and University of Iowa Community Credit Union. Iowa is host to at least two business incubators, Iowa State University Research Park and the BioVentures Center at the University of Iowa.[176] The Research Park hosts about 50 companies, among them NewLink Genetics, which develops cancer immunotherapeutics, and the U.S. animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim, Vetmedica.[176] Ethanol production consumes about a third of Iowa's corn production, and renewable fuels account for eight percent of the state's gross domestic product. A total of 39 ethanol plants produced 3.1 billion US gallons (12,000,000 m3) of fuel in 2009.[177] Renewable energy has become a major economic force in northern and western Iowa, with wind turbine electrical generation increasing exponentially since 1990.[10] In 2010, wind power in Iowa accounted for 15.4% of electrical energy produced, and 3675 megawatts of generating capacity had been installed at the end of the year.[178] Iowa ranked first of U.S. states in percentage of total power generated by wind and second in wind generating capacity behind Texas.[178] Major producers of turbines and components in Iowa include Acciona Energy of West Branch, TPI Composites of Newton, and Siemens Energy of Fort Madison. In 2016, Iowa was the headquarters for three of the top 2,000 companies for revenue.[179] They include Principal Financial, Rockwell Collins, and American Equity Investment.[180][181][182] Iowa is also headquarters to other companies including Hy-Vee, Pella Corporation, Vermeer Company, Kum & Go gas stations, Von Maur, Pioneer Hi-Bred, and Fareway.[183][184][185][186][187][188][189] Taxation[edit] Tax is collected by the Iowa Department of Revenue.[190] Iowa imposes taxes on net state income of individuals, estates, and trusts. There are nine income tax brackets, ranging from 0.36% to 8.98%, as well as four corporate income tax brackets ranging from 6% to 12%, giving Iowa the country's highest marginal corporate tax rate.[191] The state sales tax rate is 6%, with non-prepared food having no tax.[192] Iowa has one local option sales tax that may be imposed by counties after an election.[193] Property tax is levied on the taxable value of real property. Iowa has more than 2,000 taxing authorities. Most property is taxed by more than one taxing authority. The tax rate differs in each locality and is a composite of county, city or rural township, school district and special levies. Iowa allows its residents to deduct their federal income taxes from their state income taxes.[194] Transportation[edit] Interstate highways[edit] Iowa's major interstates, larger cities, and counties Iowa has four primary interstate highways. Interstate 29 (I-29) travels along the state's western edge through Council Bluffs and Sioux City. I-35 travels from the Missouri state line to the Minnesota state line through the state's center, including Des Moines. I-74 begins at I-80 just northeast of Davenport. I-80 travels from the Nebraska state line to the Illinois state line through the center of the state, including Council Bluffs, Des Moines, Iowa City, and the Quad Cities. I-380 is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, which travels from I-80 near Iowa City through Cedar Rapids ending in Waterloo and is part of the Avenue of the Saints highway. Iowa is among the few jurisdictions where municipalities install speed cameras on interstate highways providing a substantial revenue source from out of state drivers.[195] Airports with scheduled flights[edit] See also: List of airports in Iowa Iowa is served by several regional airports including the Des Moines International Airport, the Eastern Iowa Airport, in Cedar Rapids, Quad City International Airport, in Moline, Illinois, and Eppley Airfield, in Omaha, Nebraska.

National[edit] Further information: List of United States Senators from Iowa and List of United States Representatives from Iowa The two U.S. Senators: Chuck Grassley (R), in office since 1981 Joni Ernst (R), in office since 2015 The four U.S. Representatives: Abby Finkenauer (D), First district Dave Loebsack (D), Second district Cindy Axne (D), Third district Steve King (R), Fourth district After the 2010 United States Census and the resulting redistricting, Iowa lost one seat in Congress, falling to four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Incumbent U.S. Representatives Leonard Boswell (D) and Tom Latham (R) ran against each other in 2012 in the third congressional district which had new boundaries; Latham won and retired after the 2014 elections. King represented the old fifth congressional district. Political parties[edit] Main article: Political party strength in Iowa Samuel J. Kirkwood, founder of the Iowa Republican Party, abolitionist, and Iowa's Civil War Governor In Iowa, the term "political party" refers to political organizations which have received two percent or more of the votes cast for president or governor in the "last preceding general election". Iowa recognizes three political parties—the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, and the Libertarian Party.[199] The Libertarian Party obtained official political party status in 2017 as a result of presidential candidate Gary Johnson receiving 3.8% of the Iowa vote in the 2016 general election.[200] Third parties, officially termed "nonparty political organizations", can appear on the ballot as well. Four of these have had candidates on the ballot in Iowa since 2004 for various positions: the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Pirate Party, and the Socialist Workers Party.[201][202] Voter trends[edit] See also: United States presidential elections in Iowa As a result of the 2010 elections, each party controlled one house of the Iowa General Assembly: the House had a Republican majority, while the Senate had a Democratic majority. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans gained control of the Senate. Incumbent Democratic governor Chet Culver was defeated in 2010 by Republican Terry Branstad, who had served as governor from 1983 to 1999. On December 14, 2015, Branstad became the longest serving governor in U.S. history, serving (at that time) 20 years, 11 months, and 3 days; eclipsing George Clinton, who served 21 years until 1804.[203] Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds succeeded him on May 24, 2017, following Branstad's appointment as U.S. Ambassador to China. As of February 1, 2016, there were 2,095,639 registered voters. 635,687 or 30.3% were Democrats, 800,629 or 38.2% of voters were not registered in a party, 651,039 or 31.1% were Republicans, and 8,284 or 0.004% were registered with another party.[204] Presidential caucus[edit] Main article: Iowa caucuses The state gets considerable attention every four years because the Iowa caucus, gatherings of voters to select delegates to the state conventions, is the first presidential caucus in the country. The caucuses, held in January or February of the election year, involve people gathering in homes or public places and choosing their candidates, rather than casting secret ballots as is done in a presidential primary election.[205] Along with the New Hampshire primary the following week, Iowa's caucuses have become the starting points for choosing the two major-party candidates for president.[206] The national and international media give Iowa and New Hampshire extensive attention, which gives Iowa voters leverage.[207] In 2007 presidential campaign spending was the seventh highest in the country.[208] Civil rights[edit] Racial equality[edit] The Union Block building, Mount Pleasant, scene of early civil rights and women's rights activities In the 19th century Iowa was among the earliest states to enact prohibitions against race discrimination, especially in education, but was slow to achieve full integration in the 20th century. In the very first decision of the Iowa Supreme Court—In Re the Matter of Ralph,[209] decided July 1839—the Court rejected slavery in a decision that found a slave named Ralph became free when he stepped on Iowa soil, 26 years before the end of the Civil War.[210] The state did away with racial barriers to marriage in 1851, more than 100 years before the U.S. Supreme Court would ban miscegenation statutes nationwide.[211] The Iowa Supreme Court decided Clark v. The board of directors[212] in 1868, ruling that racially segregated "separate but equal" schools had no place in Iowa, 85 years before Brown v. Board of Education.[210] By 1875, a number of additional court rulings effectively ended segregation in Iowa schools.[213] Social and housing discrimination continued against Blacks at state universities until the 1950s.[214] The Court heard Coger v. The North Western Union Packet Co.[215] in 1873, ruling against racial discrimination in public accommodations 91 years before the U.S. Supreme Court reached the same decision.[210] In 1884, the Iowa Civil Rights Act apparently outlawed discrimination by businesses, reading: "All persons within this state shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, chophouses, eating houses, lunch counters, and all other places where refreshments are served, public conveyances, barber shops, bathhouses, theaters, and all other places of amusement." However, the courts chose to narrowly apply this act, allowing de facto discrimination to continue.[216] Racial discrimination at public businesses was not deemed illegal until 1949, when the court ruled in State of Iowa v. Katz that businesses had to serve customers regardless of race; the case began when Edna Griffin was denied service at a Des Moines drugstore.[217] Full racial civil rights were codified under the Iowa Civil Rights Act of 1965.[218] Women's rights[edit] As with racial equality, Iowa was a vanguard in women's rights in the mid-19th century, but did not allow women the right to vote until the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1920, Iowa legislature being one of the ratifying votes.[219] In 1847, the University of Iowa became the first public university in the U.S. to admit men and women on an equal basis.[220] In 1869, Iowa became the first state in the union to admit women to the practice of law, with the Court ruling women may not be denied the right to practice law in Iowa and admitting Arabella A. Mansfield to the practice of law.[210] Several attempts to grant full voting rights to Iowa women were defeated between 1870 and 1919. In 1894 women were given "partial suffrage", which allowed them to vote on issues, but not for candidates. It was not until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment that women had full suffrage in Iowa.[221] Although Iowa supported the Federal Equal Rights Amendment, in 1980 and 1992 Iowa voters rejected an Equal Rights Amendment to the state constitution.[222] Iowa added the word "women" to the Iowa Constitution in 1998. After the amendment, it reads: "All men and women are, by nature, free and equal, and have certain inalienable rights—among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness."[223] In May 2018 Iowa signed into law one of the country's most restrictive abortion bans: the requirement that a doctor cannot perform an abortion if they can detect a fetal heartbeat, which in many cases would restrict abortions pregnancies less than six weeks old.[224] It was struck down in January 2019, when an Iowa state judge ruled that the "fetal heartbeat" law was unconstitutional.[225] LGBT rights[edit] See also: LGBT rights in Iowa The state's law criminalizing same-sex sexual activity was repealed in June 1976, 27 years before Lawrence v. Texas. In 2007, the Iowa Legislature added "sexual orientation" and "gender identity" to the protected classes listed in the Iowa Civil Rights Act.[226] On April 3, 2009, the Iowa Supreme Court decided Varnum v. Brien,[227] holding in a unanimous decision,[228] the state's law forbidding same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. This made Iowa the third state in the U.S. and first in the Midwest to permit same-sex marriage.[229] [230] Sister jurisdictions[edit] Iowa has ten official partner jurisdictions:[231] Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan (1960) Yucatán, Mexico (1964) Hebei Province, People's Republic of China (1983) Terengganu, Malaysia (1987) Taiwan, Republic of China (1989) Stavropol Krai, USSR/Russia (1989) Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine (1996) Veneto Region, Italy (1997) Republic of Kosovo (2013) Education[edit] Primary and secondary schools[edit] See also: List of school districts in Iowa Iowa was one of the leading states in the high school movement, and continues to be among the top educational performers today.[232] The four-year graduation rate for high schoolers was 91.3% in 2017.[233] Iowa's schools are credited with the highest graduation rate in the nation as of 2019.[234] Iowa has 333 school districts,[233] 1,329 school buildings and has the 14th lowest student-to-teacher ratio of 14.2.[235] Teacher pay is ranked 22nd, with the average salary being $55,647.[235] As of 2015[update] transportation spending is a significant part of the budgets of rural school districts as many are geographically large and must transport students across vast distances. This reduces the amount of money spent on other aspects of the districts.[236] The state's oldest functioning school building is located in Bellevue, Iowa in the historic Jackson County Courthouse which has been in continuous use as a school since 1848.[237] Colleges and universities[edit] See also: List of colleges and universities in Iowa Palmer Chiropractic College in Davenport is the first school of chiropractic in the world. The Iowa Board of Regents is composed of nine citizen volunteers appointed by the governor to provide policymaking, coordination, and oversight of the state's three public universities, two special K–12 schools, and affiliated centers.[238] The special K–12 schools include the Iowa School for the Deaf in Council Bluffs and the Iowa Braille and Sight Saving School in Vinton.[238] Both Iowa State University and The University of Iowa are research universities[239] and members of the prestigious Association of American Universities.[240] In addition to the three state universities, Iowa has multiple private colleges and universities. Culture[edit] Arts[edit] Schaeffer Hall (University of Iowa, Iowa City) Riverside's "favorite son" The Clint Eastwood movie The Bridges of Madison County, based on the popular novel of the same name, took place and was filmed in Madison County.[241] What's Eating Gilbert Grape, based on the Peter Hedges novel of the same name, is set in the fictional Iowa town of Endora. Hedges was born in West Des Moines.[242] Slipknot, a heavy metal band, was formed in Des Moines in 1995.[243] In 1992, Corey Taylor future co-founder of Slipknot formed Stone Sour in Des Moines. The band lasted until 1997.[244] Jazz cornetist, pianist, and composer Bix Beiderbecke was born in Davenport. This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.
