article cnn cnnaccording recent paper earth catch directly crosshair cosmic hurricane swarm nearly 100 star accompany even greater amount dark matter aim directly stellar neighborhood nothing stop fact vanguard already upon sound like perfect summer blockbuster movie star rock chris pratt maybe scarlett johansson charlize theron don lincoln except real danger well actually potentially incredibly fascinating lot interesting scientific interconnection really go story start last april gaia satellite announce location trajectory 2 billion star vicinity milky way surround sun release datum public scientist able look datum set see spot anything peculiar galaxy like milky way common behavior star orbit center galaxy manner broadly similar planet orbit sun however star exhibit unusual motion year ago astronomer identify stellar stream pass celestial neighborhood one call s1 stream 1 consist nearly 100 star similar age composition orbit milky way direction exactly opposite normal star kind like handful car drive wrong way highway except much greater distance likelihood collision star spread thousand light year will pass solar system neighborhood course million year read something wrong dark matter astronomer identify s1 part remnant dwarf galaxy collide milky way consume epic episode cosmic cannibalism dwarf galaxy small typically 1 mass milky way orbit larger galaxy collide bigger galaxy add mass parent appear happen case s1 although process take probably billion year dwarf galaxy often disproportionately large fraction dark matter dark matter hypothetical stillundiscovered form matter interact gravitationally scientist propose existence explain many astronomical mystery example observation galaxy rotate faster explain known law physics star gas compose dark matter yet observe hypothesize existence simplest economical explanation myriad astronomical mystery average entire universe dark matter think five time prevalent ordinary mass star gas planet dwarf galaxy fraction dark matter often higher fornax wellstudied dwarf galaxy orbit milky way researcher estimate dark matter 10 100 time greater mass find star number hold s1 dark matter s1 stream pass earth much higher velocity ordinary dark matter orbit milky way twice fast think s1 dark matter fly solar system speed 550 km 12 million mph number impressive misleading dark matter exist extremely diffuse will discernible effect solar system mystery early universe enormous black hole dark matter observe yet velocity number speculative although strongly support large body evidence however prospect high velocity dark matter fly earth suggest opportunity detect paper prestigious journal physical review d researcher ciaran ohare collaborator calculate possibility discover dark matter use exist propose dark matter detector consider two variety dark matter particle heavy kind call wimp weakly interact massive particle light kind call axion ultimate nature dark matter know important open possibility find detector evaluate find wimp certain range particle mass however look axion possibility appear prospects even better light mass manner axion interact detector apparatus simply better chance see axion axion exist course experiment name like admx madmax abracadabra able will able search signature dark matter propose recent paper consist technology design interact axion strong magnetic field convert ordinary microwave radio wave easily detect stay date sign new newsletter join twitter facebook important remember s1 stream pose credible threat earth humanity need
