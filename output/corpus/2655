The HIDTA program oversees 29 regional HIDTAs in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, and the District of Columbia. With HIDTA presence in over 600 counties across the country, an estimated two-thirds of Americans live in a HIDTA-designated county. Each HIDTA is guided by an Executive Board that includes an equal number of regional Federal and non-Federal (state, local, and tribal) law enforcement leaders and is managed by an Executive Director who has previous experience in anti-drug law enforcement. Law enforcement officials interested in participating in the HIDTA program can click here for more information. For more information about the HIDTAs’ work and successes, click here.
