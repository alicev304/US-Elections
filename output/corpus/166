The blazon is defined in Executive Order 11884 as: The Coat of Arms of the Vice President of the United States shall be of the following design: SHIELD: Paleways of thirteen pieces argent and gules, a chief azure; upon the breast of an American eagle displayed holding in his dexter talon an olive branch proper and in his sinister a bundle of thirteen arrows gray, and in his beak a gray scroll inscribed "E PLURIBUS UNUM" sable. CREST: Behind and above the eagle a radiating glory or, on which appears an arc of thirteen cloud puffs gray, and a constellation of thirteen mullets gray. The Seal of the Vice President of the United States shall consist of the Coat of Arms encircled by the words "Vice President of the United States." The design is the same as the Seal of the President of the United States, except that there is no ring of stars, the clouds are gray (instead of proper), the stars are gray (instead of argent), the scroll is gray (instead of white), the arrows are gray (instead of proper), and the background colors and inscription (obviously) differ.

A white scroll is incorrect. I think the previous chief blue is just as correct, but doesn't matter to me as much. An incorrect emblazonment is worse. 02:44, 4 January 2015 2,437 × 2,437 (229 KB) Fry1989 Scroll is white, you also removed other corrections to the image. 23:44, 3 January 2015 2,437 × 2,437 (212 KB) Clindberg Reverted to version as of 18:08, 15 December 2009 -- version with correct scroll color of gray 01:38, 29 November 2010 2,437 × 2,437 (229 KB) Fry1989 fixes 18:08, 15 December 2009 2,437 × 2,437 (212 KB) Clindberg Make the stem of the olive branch brown, per EO 11884, lighten up the gray (spec says "silver gray" and photos of seal use lighter than we had), and redo the inscription to be more like the font in the Executive Order (not sure which I prefer). 17:03, 6 August 2008 2,437 × 2,437 (179 KB) Clindberg Change the scroll to use real gradients. Use the same size as the original... same as presidential seal FWIW. 16:12, 6 August 2008 1,000 × 1,000 (181 KB) Clindberg Redo inscription to more closely match the style on the SVG of the presidential seal. Tried to improve the gradients in the scroll (there were some gaps before). 03:53, 5 August 2008 1,000 × 1,000 (179 KB) Clindberg Change clouds, scroll, and arrows to gray, per the official blazon.
