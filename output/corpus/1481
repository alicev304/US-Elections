Wikipedia articles should be used for background information, as a reference for correct terminology and search terms, and as a starting point for further research. As with any community-built reference, there is a possibility for error in Wikipedia's content—please check your facts against multiple sources and read our disclaimers for more information.

 When using the LaTeX package url (\usepackage{url} somewhere in the preamble), which tends to give much more nicely formatted web addresses, the following may be preferred:   @misc{ wiki:xxx,
    author = "{Wikipedia contributors}",
    title = "United States presidential election --- {Wikipedia}{,} The Free Encyclopedia",
    year = "2020",
    howpublished = "\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_presidential_election&oldid=951039529}",
