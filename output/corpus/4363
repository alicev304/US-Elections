Contents 1 Sidebar 2 Images at the bottom of the box 3 Labels 4 Error Sidebar[edit] since navigational templates, like sidebars, are to be excluded in the print version, I have switched this template to used the standard {{sidebar}} template, which automatically excludes it from print. any superfluous styling can be added using standard methods. thank you. Frietjes (talk) 01:08, 18 December 2015 (UTC) @Frietjes: I don't know what you are doing, and I don't know what a "print version" is. However these changes do not work on mobile platforms. I have triple-checked on Apple and Windows using multiple internet sources and have refreshed caches, etc. These templates do not render whatsoever on mobile formats, desktop, tablet, or phone. Furthermore, on a desktop format they appear disorganized and poorly construed. Spartan7W § 01:09, 18 December 2015 (UTC) see above. Frietjes (talk) 01:10, 18 December 2015 (UTC) Then why didn't you take the time to construct them as to not alter the way they appear? Spartan7W § 01:11, 18 December 2015 (UTC) The sidebar version looks much better! Thanks!

Eric S.V. (talk) 13:30, 9 July 2016 (UTC) Error[edit] Can someone please fix the image on the current version, it looks very uneven and sticks out from all the rest of the templated like this.--JJBers (talk) 00:11, 17 September 2016 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Hillary_Clinton_series&oldid=829342951" Categories: Template-Class biography articles Template-Class biography (politics and government) articles NA-importance biography (politics and government) articles Politics and government work group articles Template-Class Hillary Clinton articles NA-importance Hillary Clinton articles WikiProject Hillary Clinton articles Template-Class Women's History articles NA-importance Women's History articles WikiProject Women's History articles All WikiProject Women-related pages Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Template Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Download as PDF Languages This page was last edited on 8 March 2018, at 01:26 (UTC).
