Yes! I want to support VOTE411, which provides critical election information in all 50 states. The League of Women Voters is committed to ensuring voters have the information they need to successfully participate in elections. The League created VOTE411.org in 2006 and has provided tens of millions of voters with information about the election process and information directly from candidates regarding their vision for their community's and America’s future. Every election, whether local, state, or federal, is important to ensuring our laws and policies reflect the values and beliefs of our communities.
