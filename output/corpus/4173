The governor has a duty to enforce state laws and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the New Jersey Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason or impeachment.[1] There have been 55 official governors of New Jersey, 1 of which were female, with several others acting as governor for a time.[a] In the official numbering, governors are counted only once each, and traditionally, only elected governors were included. However, legislation signed on January 10, 2006, allowed acting governors who had served at least 180 days to be considered full governors. The law was retroactive to January 1, 2001; it therefore changed the titles of Donald DiFrancesco and Richard Codey, affecting Jim McGreevey's numbering.[2] The current governor is Phil Murphy, who took office on January 16, 2018.

New Jersey was one of the original thirteen colonies and was admitted as a state on December 18, 1787. Prior to declaring its independence, New Jersey was a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The first New Jersey State Constitution, ratified in 1776, provided that a governor be elected annually by the state legislature, the members of which were selected by the several counties.[3] Under this constitution, the governor was president of the upper house of the legislature, then called the Legislative Council.[3] The 1844 constitution provided for a popular vote to elect the governor,[4] who no longer presided over the upper house of the legislature, now called the Senate. The 1844 constitution also lengthened the governor's term to three years, set to start on the third Tuesday in January following an election, and barred governors from succeeding themselves.[5] The 1947 constitution extended terms to four years, and limits governors from being elected to more than two consecutive terms, though they can run again after a third term has passed.[6] The 1776 constitution provided that the vice-president of the Legislative Council would act as governor (who was president of the Council) should that office be vacant.[3] The 1844 constitution placed the president of the Senate first in the line of succession,[7] as did the subsequent 1947 constitution.[8] A constitutional amendment in 2006 created the office of lieutenant governor,[9] to be elected on the same ticket for the same term as the governor,[10] and if the office of governor is vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.[11] This office was first filled in 2010.

Until 2010, when the office of governor was vacant or the governor was unable to fulfill his/her duties through injury, the President of the State Senate served as the acting governor. The Senate President continued in the legislative role during his/her tenure as the state's acting chief executive, thus giving the person control over executive and legislative authority. The acting governor served either until the a special election (which would occur if the governor died, resigned or was removed from office with more than 16 months before the end of the term), until the governor recovered from his/her injuries, or, if the governor died, resigned or was removed from office less than 16 months before end of the term, until the end of the term. Richard Codey served as acting governor of New Jersey until January 2006, following the resignation of Jim McGreevey in late 2004. Following the resignation of Christine Todd Whitman in 2001 to become EPA Administrator, Donald DiFrancesco assumed the acting governor's post. The position of lieutenant governor was created in the 2005 state election effective with the 2009 election. Following Whitman's resignation and DiFrancesco's departure, John O. Bennett served as acting governor for three and a half days. During that time, he signed a few bills into law, gave a State of the State Address, and held parties at Drumthwacket, the New Jersey governor's mansion. Similarly, Richard J. Codey served as acting governor as well. Because control of the New Jersey State Senate was split, resulting in two Senate co-presidents, Codey and Bennett, each held the office of acting governor for three days. Perhaps this spectacle as much as any other factor led to the voters' decision to amend the state constitution to create the office of Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey. Other high offices held[edit] This is a table of congressional seats, other federal offices, and other governorships held by governors. All representatives and senators mentioned represented New Jersey. Acting governors are included only when they filled a vacancy in the office of governor, not when they acted for a time when the governor was out of state or unable to serve. * Denotes an office for which the governor resigned the governorship, in order to assume the noted office. † Denotes an office that the person resigned, to become governor.

People who acted as governor for a period when the governor was out of state or unable to serve for a period are noted with their governor. It is possible other people acted as governor for short periods but were not recorded. ^ The office of lieutenant governor was created in 2006 and was first filled in 2010. ^ Livingston died in office; as vice-president of the Legislative Council, Lawrence acted as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ a b The National Governors Association states Paterson took office on October 30; however, older books specify that he took office on October 29.[12] ^ Paterson resigned to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; as vice-president of the Legislative Council, Henderson acted as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ Howell was in Pennsylvania in command of the New Jersey militia during the Whiskey Rebellion; during his absence, Thomas Henderson, as vice-president of the Legislative Council, acted as governor from September 20 to December 25, 1794.[13] ^ The 1802 election was deadlocked, with the legislature unable to pick a candidate, giving up on November 25, 1802. Lambert, as vice-president of the Legislative Council, acted as governor until the next election.[14] ^ Bloomfield was in New York in command of Military District 3 during the War of 1812; during his absence, Charles Clark, as vice-president of the Legislative Council, acted as governor from June 1 to October 29, 1812, when Bloomfield's term ended.[15] ^ Pennington resigned to be a federal judge in the District of New Jersey; as vice-president of the Legislative Council, Kennedy acted as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ All official listings omit Kennedy, who acted as governor for four months.[16] ^ Dickerson resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate; Williamson was elected by the legislature to succeed him.[17] No source mentions anyone acting as governor between Dickerson's resignation and Williamson's election; the vice-president of the Legislative Council at the time was Jesse Upson, so he likely acted as governor.[18] ^ Williamson was known to be a Federalist; though the Federalist Party ceased existing around 1820, no sources say Williamson changed his party affiliation, perhaps choosing to remain loyal to the Federalist ideals.[19] One source describes him as an "ex-Federalist" before he was even elected.[20] A contemporary source says he remained in office until the "Jackson party" controlled the legislature; as this is a reference to the Democratic-Republican Party, it can be assumed Williamson did not switch to that party.[21] ^ Wall was elected on October 30, 1829; however, he declined the post, effective November 6, 1829.[22] Vroom was then elected by the legislature to replace him. ^ Southard resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate; Seeley was vice-president of the Legislative Council at the time, but he was elected governor rather than simply acting in the post for the rest of the term.[23] ^ The constitution increased term lengths from one to three years beginning with this term.[5] ^ Griggs resigned to be United States Attorney General. As president of the senate, Voorhees acted as governor until he resigned from the senate; he had been nominated for governor for the 1898 election, but the constitution prohibited governors from succeeding themselves, so he resigned to run, winning the race.[24] This left Watkins, as speaker of the house of representatives, acting as governor for the remainder of the term.</ref> ^ Voorhees was out of the country in Europe for several weeks in 1900; William M. Johnson, as president of the Senate, formally acted as governor from May 21 to June 19.[25][26][27] ^ Murphy was out of the state twice in 1904; Edmund W. Wakelee, as president of the Senate, formally acted as governor twice, and according to page 284 the 1905 Manual of the Legislature, served from April 25 to June 5, when Murphy was in Europe, and from June 14 to June 27, when Murphy was visiting Chicago and St. Louis.[28] However, page 16 of the same book states that he served from April 25 to June 5, and June 15 to June 27.[25] He actually took the oaths of office on April 26 and June 14.[27] ^ Fort was out of the state for some time in 1909; Joseph Sherman Frelinghuysen, Sr., as president of the Senate, acted as governor for an unknown period.[29] ^ Wilson resigned to be President of the United States. As president of the senate, Fielder acted as governor until he resigned from the senate; he had been nominated for governor for the 1898 election, but the constitution prohibited governors from succeeding themselves, so he resigned to run, winning the race.[30] This left Taylor, as speaker of the house of representatives, acting as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ Wilson was out of the state for multiple periods during his administration.[26] Documented episodes include from May 3 to June 3, 1911, during which time Ernest R. Ackerman, as president of the Senate, acted as governor,[31][32] though another source states he took the oath on May 4.[33] Ackerman also acted as governor from October 25, 1911, for about a week, and again for about a week in mid-November, 1911.[34] John Dyneley Prince became president of the Senate in 1912, and is known to have acted as governor on at least 11 different occasions.[34] ^ Fielder was out of the state for a time in June 1914; John W. Slocum, as president of the Senate, acted as governor for an unknown period.[35] Walter Evans Edge later became president of the Senate, and acted as governor for five weeks in 1915.[36] Later again, George W. F. Gaunt became president of the Senate and acted as governor, though only two days are specifically known: September 19, 1916 and October 9, 1916.[37] ^ a b One source states that George W. F. Gaunt, as president of the Senate, acted as governor in 1917, but it is unknown if he was acting in place of James Fairman Fielder or Walter Evans Edge.[26] ^ Edge resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate; as president of the senate, Runyon acted as governor until his senate term ended, then Case acted as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ Edge was out of the state for a time in 1918; Thomas F. McCran, as president of the Senate, is known to have acted as governor, but for an unknown period.[26] ^ Moore resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate. As president of the senate, Powell acted as governor until his senate term expired, at which point Prall, as the new president of the senate, acted as governor for the remainder of the term. ^ This was the first term under the 1947 constitution, which increased term lengths to four years.[6] ^ Whitman resigned to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. As president of the senate, DiFrancesco acted as governor until his senate term expired. However, a 2006 law considers anyone who has acted as governor longer than 180 days to be considered a full governor, retroactive to January 1, 2001, and as such, DiFrancesco is considered to have fully succeeded to the post. However, there were 90 minutes between the end of the senate term and the beginning of the next one; during this time, Attorney General Farmer acted as governor.[38] The new state senate was evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.[39] The compromise to pick a senate president – and therefore, an acting governor – was to have John Bennett, a Republican, act as governor from 1:30pm January 8 to 12:01am January 12, and Democrat Richard Codey would then act from 12:01am January 12 to noon on January 15, at which point the elected governor took office.[40] ^ McGreevey resigned due to a sex scandal. As president of the senate, Codey acted as governor until his senate term expired. However, a 2006 law considers anyone who has acted as governor longer than 180 days to be considered a full governor, retroactive to January 1, 2001, and as such, Codey is considered to have fully succeeded to the post. ^ Corzine was severely injured in a car accident on April 12, 2007; Richard Codey, as president of the Senate, acted as governor until May 7, 2007.[41] Corzine also left the country in 2010 for a vacation to Switzerland; Stephen M. Sweeney, as president of the Senate, acted as governor from January 14 to around January 17.[42] ^ Murphy's first term expires on January 18, 2022.
