Today, millions of voters across six states will cast their ballots for the two viable Democratic candidates left: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders. What began as a contest with historic diversity of race, gender and sexual orientation has come down to two heterosexual white men over 70. Astead W.

Some say the personal criticism she weathered, especially from Mr. Biden, was sexist.She began her campaign with an avalanche of progressive policy proposals, but dropped out after failing to attract a broader political coalition in a Democratic Party increasingly, if not singularly, focused on defeating President Trump. 34 min FEB 28, 2020 Biden‚Äôs Last Hope Biden‚Äôs Last Hope Former vice president Joseph R.

So how are candidates faring among congregations? 34 min FEB 21, 2020 An Anti-Endorsement in Nevada An Anti-Endorsement in Nevada Note: This episode contains strong language. Senator Bernie Sanders is a staunchly pro-union candidate. But he has found himself mired in an escalating battle over health care with the largest labor union in Nevada. With what some call ‚Äúthe best insurance in America‚Äù ‚Äî the fruit of struggles including a six-year strike ‚Äî members of the Culinary Workers Union have been reluctant to support Mr. Sanders‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedicare for All‚Äù plan. We went to Nevada to ask how what is effectively an anti-endorsement of Mr. Sanders from the union‚Äôs leaders may affect his support in the state‚Äôs caucuses on Saturday.

While many polls show Senator Bernie Sanders leading in this year‚Äôs primary, the caucus debacle in Iowa meant no single candidate left that first contest with full momentum. We flew from Iowa to New Hampshire, following the campaign trail and talking to voters about whether Democrats who don‚Äôt support Sanders are coalescing around another choice.

With voting for 2020 set to begin in Iowa on Monday, ‚ÄúThe Daily‚Äù sat down with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, to discuss the lessons he ‚Äî and the organization ‚Äî learned from 2016.

Customer Reviews See All 4.4 out of 5 108 Ratings 108 Ratings realcheddabob , 03/11/2020 üíô I love everything about this podcast Randel317 , 03/10/2020 Fairly enjoyable until Warren episode I learned The NY Times only wants to write the story the Warren campaign failed due to sexism. Instead of researching and exploring the other failures of the campaign they only briefly ask at the midpoint of the podcast if there‚Äôs another reason can her campaign could have failed. Instead of exploring that question and exploring her fall they skip right back to it being about sexism. This kind of reporting, that lacks asking tough questions, or exploring the failures of the campaign, sans her being a woman are why I cancelled my subscription. JamesKnapp , 03/10/2020 Boring Show, Terrible Reporting This show keeps interrupting The Daily feed and it needs to stop. I love what the New York Times is doing in podcasts but this show is so boring and pointless. The first episode I spent 1/3 of the time listening to the reporters waking up to houses, and the latest episode was interviewing the Warren campaign who answered every questions with a long, drawn out ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù Just riveting. Every other part of this show is listening to show person in some state give a vague opinion about a candidate they are sort of invested in kinda. It‚Äôs clear in the editing room they are coming back with garbage reporting and trying to fit it in the Daily mold so no one knows it actually is about nothing.
