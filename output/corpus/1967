distant universe visible ultraviolet nearinfrared light different wavelength light allow hubble peer different region space never observe orbit earth distance 340 mile well distorting effect earths atmosphere observe space near far hubble give new sharp clarity view deep space say jennifer wiseman hubble senior project scientist nasas goddard space flight center maryland come simply hubble place

hubble discover 1920 distant cloud universe actually galaxy die 1953 hubble rely work astronomer henrietta swan leavitts discovery period brightness pulsate star call cepheid variable hubbles work lead revelation galaxy one many forever change perspective place universe hubble continue work discover distant galaxy appear move rapidly suggest live expand universe start big bang one main reason build hubble able measure precisely expansion rate universe wiseman say new hubble image giant red nebula smaller blue neighbor nebula release commemorate 30th anniversary telescope hubbles ability observe activity distant faint galaxy weve able measure expansion rate still refine recent year hubble along observatory major contributor discovery expansion rate accelerate surprise now call phenom behind dark energy detection universe expansion rate help lead 2011 nobel prize physics award saul perlmutter brian p schmidt adam g riess discovery accelerate expansion universe observation distant supernova nasa show picture hubble space telescope take birthday 30 year hubble enable astronomer around world study black hole mysterious dark energy distant galaxy galactic merger observe planet outside solar system form around star star formation death even spotted previously unknown moon around pluto hubble characterize atmosphere exoplanet spot weather shift planet solar system look across 97 universe effectively peer back time telescope expect last 15 year still go strong hubble also design service upgrade time december 1993 may 2009 astronaut launch space shuttle rendezvous telescope make repair replace gyroscope instrument first one 1993 help fix hubbles infamous mirror flaw cause blurry image telescope astronaut install corrective optics new instrument fix mission take year planning preparation require astronaut leave shuttle conduct spacewalk inside component telescope repair install instrument telescope move 17000 mile per hour inclined 285 degree equator around earth show work together make something fantastically successful gratifying humankind wiseman say work hubble various role 20 year discovery expect unexpected 1994 hubble chance watch violent event solar system comet shoemakerlevy 9 unexpectedly draw collision jupiter comet pull apart fragment astronomers see 21 piece comet hit jupiter leave temporary black scar within planet iconic cloud never see anything like hubble snap new portrait saturn astounding realization solar system body interact energetic way maybe solar system completely safe place wiseman say since hubble give dramatic show planet solar system weather change asteroid actually collide moon planet solar system show activity sign water basically solar system might fact compare star system hubble also spot four moon orbit pluto never see nix hydra kerberos styx telescope also help scout distant kuiper belt object name 2014 mu69 one billion mile beyond pluto 2019 become distant object ever visit spacecraft new horizons mission fly now object know arrokoth jupiters new portrait snap hubble outside solar system hubble explore milky way galaxy neighbor galaxy dramatic colorful image hubble know largely active nebula galaxy bright cloud gas dust star form 1997 servicing mission install nicmos hubble near infrared camera multiobject spectrometer new instrument allow observatory peer thick gas dust surround star nursery galaxy star emit infrared light rodger thompson lead nicmos astronomy professor university arizonas steward observatory begin work proposal instrument 1984 shape future infrared astronomy reveal secret star formation look back earliest galaxy universe nearinfrared image pillar creation column gas dust new star bear show new star apparent visible light version image see gallery see dusty region star form exquisite detail hubble thompson say able trace star formation history universe way back earliest galaxy percent age universe form nearinfrared seemingly blank part sky appear light evidence distant galaxy one expect thompson say image history book universe astronomer find many young star disk dusty debris swirl around planet form hubble launch 1990 one know single planet outside solar system say tom brown hubble mission head space telescope science institute maryland astronomers find exoplanet 1990s use telescope hubble able groundbreak science follow observation study exoplanet atmosphere hubbles first exoplanet science include measure another planet atmosphere confirm oldest known exoplanet detect first organic molecule exoplanet first change exoplanet atmosphere today exoplanet science account 20 telescope observational time telescope enable mapping dark matter even though dark matter invisible little telescope retire change see universe dark matter mysterious substance make matter universe know observe emit observable radiation wiseman say know gravitational effect hubble use map dark matter effect gravitational lense gravitational lensing also allow hubble look deeper early day universe occur cluster galaxy create distort gravitational field act natural giant magnifying glass distant galaxy beyond hubbles view capability hubble capture image galactic hit run hubble also enable astronomer realize galaxy tend merge one another capture dramatic image merger unfold across universe milky way galaxy grow current size merge smaller galaxy hubble credit help astronomer realize supermassive black hole ubiquitous center giant galaxy hubble able observe gas fall galactic center near speed light now consider fundamental understanding brown say think universe whole believe hubble open eye recognition galaxy change dramatically cosmic time wiseman say future hubble hubbles scientist believe telescope will keep operate least 2025 longer provide astronomer excellent opportunity hubble overlap new spacebased telescope come online soon like nasa james webb space telescope set launch 2021 webb infrared observatory together combined capability provide complete picture target observe webb will provide detailed look exoplanet atmosphere peer deeper earliest day universe ever hubble continue contribute incredible discovery follow detection observation telescope year hubble perfect complement nasa great observatory include chandra xray observatory recently retire infrared spitzer space telescope well groundbased observatory hubble capture view star formation swan nebula use follow detection gravitational wave explosion neutron star collision ligo virgo gravitational wave detector hubble actively follow journey interstellar visitor pass solar system like interstellar asteroid oumuamua 2017 interstellar comet 2iborisov still telescope next great detective universe get better scientific now ever wiseman say excite will use come year new discovery complement newer observatory hubbles mission come end optical ultraviolet capability reproduce anytime soon thing similar luvoir large uvopticalir surveyor concept multiwavelength space observatory develop may launch late 2030s 2040s brown say depend hubble conclude leave massive gap scientist depend hubble observation work come hubble observation incredible image game town brown say hubble provide 14 million observation 30 year fuel 17000 peerreviewed scientific publication datum make prolific space observatory history accord nasa hubbles archival datum will provide wealth scientific opportunity decade ahead now hope telescope will continue year maybe even decade come aging graceful well understand way operate just powerful
