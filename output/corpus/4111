These events will elect most of the 2,550[a] delegates to send to the Republican National Convention. Delegates to the national convention may otherwise be elected by the respective state party organizations. The delegates to the national convention will vote, by ballot, to select the Republican Party's nominee for president of the United States in the 2020 election, where the majority will be bound by the results of their respective state contests on the first ballot. The delegates also approve the party platform and vice-presidential nominee. Incumbent president Donald Trump informally launched his bid for re-election on February 18, 2017. He launched his reelection campaign earlier in his presidency than any of his predecessors did. He was followed by former governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld, who announced his campaign on April 15, 2019, and former Illinois congressman Joe Walsh, who declared his candidacy on August 25, 2019. Former governor of South Carolina and U.S. representative Mark Sanford launched a primary challenge on September 8, 2019. In addition, businessman Rocky De La Fuente entered the race on May 16, 2019, but was not widely recognized as a major candidate. In February 2019, the Republican National Committee voted to provide undivided support to Trump.[5][6] Several states have decided to cancel their primaries and caucuses.[7] Other states were encouraged to use "winner-takes-all" or "winner-takes-most" systems to award delegates instead of using proportional allocation.[8][9] Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.[10] Contents 1 Primary race overview 2 Candidates 2.1 Presumptive nominee 2.2 Other candidates 2.2.1 On the ballot in one or more states 2.3 Withdrawn candidates 2.4 Declined to be candidates 2.4.1 Endorsed Trump 2.4.2 Others 3 Debates 4 Cancelation of state caucuses or primaries 5 Timeline 5.1 Overview 5.2 2017–18 5.3 2019 5.4 2020 5.4.1 January 5.4.2 February 5.4.3 March 5.4.4 April 6 Primary and caucus calendar 7 Election day postponements 8 Ballot access 9 National convention 10 Endorsements 10.1 Donald Trump 10.2 Withdrawn candidates 10.3 Joe Walsh 10.4 Bill Weld 11 Primary election polling 12 Rallies 13 Campaign finance 14 Results 15 See also 16 Notes 17 References Primary race overview[edit] Numerous pundits, journalists and politicians speculated that President Donald Trump might face a significant Republican primary challenger in 2020 because of his historic unpopularity in polls, his association with allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, his impeachment, and his support of unpopular policies.[11][12][13] In August 2017, reports arose beginning that members of the Republican Party were preparing a "shadow campaign" against the President, particularly from the moderate or establishment wings of the party. Then-Arizona senator John McCain said, "Republicans see weakness in this president."[14][15] Maine senator Susan Collins, Kentucky senator Rand Paul, and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie all expressed doubts in 2017 that Trump would be the 2020 nominee, with Collins stating "it's too difficult to say."[16][17] Former U.S. Senator Jeff Flake claimed in 2017 that Trump was "inviting" a primary challenger by the way he was governing.[18] Some prominent Trump critics within the GOP, including 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina,[19] former senator Jeff Flake,[20] and former Massachusetts governor and current U.S. senator Mitt Romney[21] stated they would not run against Trump for the nomination in 2020. In 2017, there were rumors of a potential bipartisan ticket consisting of Republican Ohio governor and 2016 presidential candidate John Kasich and Democratic Colorado governor John Hickenlooper.[22] Kasich and Hickenlooper denied those rumors.[23][24] In November 2018, however, Kasich asserted that he was "very seriously" considering a White House bid in 2020.[25] In August 2019, he indicated that he did not see a path to win over Trump in a Republican primary at that time, but that his opinion might change in the future.[26] On January 25, 2019, the Republican National Committee unofficially endorsed Trump.[27] After re-enrolling as a Republican in January 2019,[28] former Republican governor of Massachusetts and 2016 Libertarian vice presidential nominee Bill Weld announced the formation of a 2020 presidential exploratory committee on February 15, 2019.[29] Weld announced his 2020 presidential candidacy on April 15, 2019.[30] Weld was considered a long-shot challenger because of Trump's popularity with Republicans; furthermore, Weld's views on abortion rights, gay marriage, marijuana legalization, and other issues conflict with socially conservative positions dominant in the modern Republican party.[31] Weld withdrew from the race on March 18, 2020.[32] Former U.S. representative Joe Walsh was a strong Trump supporter in 2016, but gradually became critical of the president. On August 25, 2019, Walsh officially declared his candidacy against Trump, calling Trump an "unfit con man".[33] He then ended his campaign on February 7, 2020, calling the Republican Party a "cult" and that he likely would support whoever was the Democratic nominee in the general election.[34] Former South Carolina governor and former U.S. representative Mark Sanford officially declared his candidacy on September 8,[35] but suspended his campaign two months later on November 12, 2019.[36] Despite the mostly nominal status of his opposition, Trump has still run a vigorous campaign during this primary season, holding rallies in the February primary states.[37][38] Candidates[edit] The following two major candidates have either (a) held public office, (b) been included in a minimum of five independent national polls, or (c) received substantial media coverage.[39][40][41] Presumptive nominee[edit] Name Born Experience Home state Announcement date Campaign Withdrawal date Bound delegates[42] Popular vote[42] Contests won[d] Ref.

On May 3, 2018, the party voted to eliminate their debate committee, which, according to CNN, served as "a warning to would-be Republican rivals of President Donald Trump about his strong support among party loyalists".[123] Trump has declined any interest in participating in any primary debates, saying he was "not looking to give [opponents] any credibility".[124] Debates among the challengers have been scheduled without the RNC's involvement. Business Insider hosted a debate on September 24 featuring two of Trump's primary challengers. It took place at the news outlet's headquarters in New York City, and was hosted by Business Insider's CEO Henry Blodgett, politics editor Anthony Fisher, and columnist Linette Lopez.[125] Walsh and Weld agreed to attend, but Sanford had a scheduling conflict and eventually declined.[126][127] An invitation was also sent to the president, but he also declined.[127] Politicon held a debate between Sanford, Walsh, and Weld on October 26 at its 2019 convention in Nashville, Tennessee[128] and Forbes also held a debate between the three on October 28 at its Under 30 Summit in Detroit, Michigan.[129] Both Walsh and Weld took part in a few forums that also featured Democratic candidates.[130][131][132] Cancelation of state caucuses or primaries[edit] The Washington Examiner reported on December 19, 2018, that the South Carolina Republican Party had not ruled out forgoing a primary contest to protect Trump from any primary challengers. Party chairman Drew McKissick stated, "Considering the fact that the entire party supports the president, we'll end up doing what's in the president's best interest."[133] On January 24, another Washington Examiner report indicated that the Kansas Republican Party was "likely" to scrap its presidential caucus to "save resources".[134] In August 2019, the Associated Press reported that the Nevada Republican Party was also contemplating canceling their caucuses, with the state party spokesman, Keith Schipper, saying it "isn't about any kind of conspiracy theory about protecting the president ... He's going to be the nominee ... This is about protecting resources to make sure that the president wins in Nevada and that Republicans up and down the ballot win in 2020."[135] On September 6, both of Trump's main challengers at the time, Bill Weld and Joe Walsh, criticized these cancellations as undemocratic.[136] The Trump campaign and GOP officials cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush sought a second term in 1992 and 2004, respectively; and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were seeking reelection in 1996 and 2012, respectively.[137][138] Weld and Walsh were joined by Mark Sanford in a joint op-ed in The Washington Post on September 13, 2019 which criticized the party for cancelling those primaries.[139] Kansas,[140] Nevada and South Carolina's state committees officially voted on September 7, 2019, to cancel their caucus and primary.[7] The Arizona state Republican Party indicated two days later that it will not hold a primary.[141] These four were joined by the Alaska state Republican party on September 21, when its central committee announced they would not hold a presidential primary.[142] Virginia Republicans decided to allocate delegates at the state convention.[143] The Nevada State committee chairman said the committee would meet on February 23, 2020 and bind their delegates to Trump.[144] The Hawaii GOP voted to cancel its primary and bind its 19 delegates to Trump on December 11.[145] The New York GOP on March 3 decided to cancel its primary after neither De La Fuente, Weld, nor Walsh submitted the required number of names of their delegates in order to qualify for their ballot.[146] The delegate candidates bound to the president were thus automatically elected. Other states were instead encouraged to use "winner-takes-all" systems to award delegates instead of using proportional allocation "to avoid dissent" at the convention.[8] Timeline[edit] Overview[edit] Active campaign Exploratory committee Withdrawn candidate Midterm elections Iowa caucuses Super Tuesday Republican convention 2017–18[edit] Incumbent President Donald Trump speaking at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017 February 18, 2017: Donald Trump informally announces his candidacy for a second term and holds the first of a series of occasional reelection campaign rallies in Melbourne, Florida, only one month after assuming office.[147] June 23, 2018: Trump delivers remarks at the Nevada Republican Convention in Las Vegas.[148] July 18, 2018: Charlotte, North Carolina is chosen as the site for the 2020 Republican National Convention.[149] November 7, 2018: Trump confirms that Mike Pence will remain his vice presidential pick.[150] 2019[edit] Former Gov.
