We think we‚Äôve identified a source of inaccuracy: uneven updating at the Johns Hopkins site. They‚Äôre excellent, but their data isn‚Äôt intended for visual display. So we‚Äôre switching to the New York Times feed. Here‚Äôs our revised graph based on NYT data: Further thoughts after the jump.

Topics: the Electoral College, polls, what neuroscientists do for fun, gerrymandering‚Ä¶lots of topics. Those guys move fast! ‚Üí Post a commentTags: Politics ¬∑ Princeton ¬∑ Redistricting Why did the doubling time accelerate in New York? April 18th, 2020, 6:18pm by Sam Wang In the last few days, the doubling time of death has decreased ‚Äì an apparent acceleration. Why is that? Well‚Ä¶more people are dying now, in particular in New York. It‚Äôs not apparent in other states. Could be a backlog of reporting, in which case the doubling time will get back to lengthening soon. For now, we must assume that there‚Äôs still a problem. ‚Üí Post a commentTags: Redistricting Fixing Bugs In Democracy: Dave Daley, author of Unrigged April 17th, 2020, 5:07pm by Sam Wang Dave Daley‚Äôs the Hunter S.

Now he‚Äôs out with Unrigged, his story of how citizens are rising up all over the nation to restore and strengthen democracy. Tune in at 6:00pm Eastern!

Time to double the number of deaths, as of today: US 7.2 days, NJ 6.5 days, NY 7.3 days. The number of deaths approximately reflects new infections as of about 2-3 weeks ago. Therefore the number of new infections was doubling every 7 days. Since infection itself lasts about 2 weeks, i.e. an average of 1 week, this means that the newly infected were approximately equal to the newly recovered. That suggests the number of infected peaked ‚Äì and is therefore should be on the decline. Note that deaths is a good way to track the course of covid-19. Even if underreported, the degree of underreporting is less likely to change than the number of confirmed cases. ‚Üí 2 CommentsTags: Health Bernie Sanders‚Äôs parting gift to Wisconsin voters April 11th, 2020, 12:07pm by Sam Wang When it comes to partisan warfare, Wisconsin is at the top of any list. In 2011, Republicans, with the help of their Governor Scott Walker, committed one of the most egregious gerrymanders of all time. The General Assembly locked itself into power for a decade. Now, thanks to Bernie Sanders‚Äôs persistence, Democrats may take a small step toward building a defense against more depredations in 2021. The story you may have seen in this week‚Äôs national news is somewhat different. It is a tale of (a) Bernie mulishly refusing to get out of the Presidential race, (b) state court and the U.S. Supreme Court stepping in to limit vote-counting and prevent Governor Evers from delaying the election, and (c) long lines for voting that could spread coronavirus and depress turnout.I think all of these ideas are wrong. Today in The Hill, I argue that turnout was unusually high ‚Äì thanks to a combination of Bernie staying in the race and record levels of mail-in voting. I also think that the threat to life caused by in-person voting was likely to be minimal. Check it out. Update, April 13, 8:00pm: And, Karofsky wins, 55-45, with 1.55 million votes cast overall. The big lesson, to me, is twofold. (1) Give people a shiny object to make them turn out. (2) Get mail-in voting ready for November. There‚Äôs likely to be a second coronavirus outbreak in the fall. We have to be ready to have an orderly election that is conducted mostly by mail. Correction: In the 2019 state Supreme Court race, 1.2 million votes were cast and counted. Still not as high as last week‚Äôs turnout ‚Äì and without the motivating factor of a Democratic primary. ‚Üí 2 CommentsTags: 2020 Election ¬∑ Health ¬∑ Politics ¬∑ President ¬∑ Redistricting TODAY: Fixing Bugs in Democracy, A Virtual Town Hall with Katie Fahey April 10th, 2020, 8:34am by Sam Wang Today we‚Äôre pleased to present our latest virtual town hall on problems in our democracy and how to fix them.

This comes thanks to an unusual provision in the legislative process there, the veto session. In November, Virginia voters will vote on a constitutional amendment to give part of the redistricting power to citizens. The Princeton Gerrymandering Project‚Äôs one-page summaries of the amendment‚Äôs minority protections, commission process, and transparency requirements (which supplement our February 2020 report) describe some missing components: added protections for minorities and political parties. These protections require enabling legislation, which the General Assembly had the power to pass, but didn‚Äôt before the end of their legislative session. Governor Northam still has the power to compel a vote on this enabling legislation‚Äôs key provisions. Now presented with bills for his signature, he can also send them back modified for consideration by the General Assembly, in a take-it-or-leave-it process known as a veto session. This veto session provides one last shot at adding protections to strengthen the reform.

And we even talked about the Lochner court! Take a listen. ‚Üí Post a commentTags: 2020 Election ¬∑ Politics ¬∑ President ¬∑ U.S. Institutions Coronavirus epidemic: The end of the beginning? April 7th, 2020, 6:30am by Sam Wang Mathematical models of the disease are useful for state/national-level decisionmaking. But they don‚Äôt seem to address what we need as individuals. So Lucas Manning, Ben Deverett, and I calculated some simpler things. Basically, I think we‚Äôre at or slightly past the point of maximum personal risk. We just have to shelter for another‚Ä¶month! Yesterday I visited friends by standing outside their houses, talking at 3-4 meters. We‚Äôre also getting good at Zoom dinner parties ‚Äì distance socializing. By continuing to shelter in place, we are all doing our part. Are you tired of the sheltering? I have bad news‚Ä¶and good news. My focus is New Jersey. What I say also applies to New York City and state. I will give information about other states along the way. First, the bad news. Our state just passed 1,000 deaths. The total number of deaths has doubled in the last 3.9 days, according to our analysis. At this speed, the total number of people currently infected in N.J. is, in all likelihood, the highest it has ever been in this epidemic. Take care, now more than ever. Postpone even necessary errands for a few days. And now, the good news: the infection rate may be starting to creep down a little ‚Äì all across the nation! Even with uncertainties of counting and testing, the available evidence supports this conclusion.
