The governor is the head of the executive branch of the state government[2] and is charged with enforcing state laws.[3] The officeholder has the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Iowa General Assembly,[4] to convene the legislature,[5] as well as to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment.[6] The Governor of Iowa is also the commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[7] There have been 41 individuals who held the position of Iowa Governor, with two of those serving multiple distinct terms. The current governor, Kim Reynolds, is first woman to hold the position and was sworn in on May 24, 2017. The longest-serving is Terry Branstad, who served from 1983 to 1999 and then again from 2011 to 2017. He is the longest-serving governor in U.S. history, surpassing the previous record of 21 years set by George Clinton of New York. The shortest-serving was Robert D. Fulton, who served 16 days.

It had three governors appointed by the President of the United States. The first governor did not arrive for six weeks after the territory had been created; in the interim, territorial secretary William B. Conway acted as governor.[8] Governors of the Territory of Iowa No. Governor Term in office Appointed by 1 Robert Lucas August 15, 1838 – May 13, 1841[a] Martin Van Buren 2 John Chambers May 13, 1841[a] – November 18, 1845[b] William Henry Harrison 3 James Clarke November 18, 1845[b] – December 3, 1846[c] James K. Polk Governors of the State of Iowa[edit] The southeast portion of Iowa Territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Iowa on December 28, 1846. The first Constitution of Iowa, adopted in 1846, created the office of governor with a four-year term,[11], with no specific start date. The 1857 constitution reduced this term to two years,[12] but an amendment in 1972 increased this back to four years.[13] The 1857 constitution also set the start of the term to the second Monday in the January following the election,[14] which was moved one day later by a 1988 amendment.[15] The office of lieutenant governor was created in the 1857 constitution, elected for the same term as the governor.[16] An amendment in 1988 specified that the lieutenant governor would be elected on the same ticket as the governor.[17] If the office becomes vacant, it devolves upon the lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term or vacancy.[18] Prior to 1857, if the office became vacant, the Secretary of State of Iowa would act as governor.[19] There is no term limit on the number of terms a governor may serve.

He arrived in the state on May 12 and took office the next day. Lucas was out of the capital at the time and did not formally resign his commission until June 17, per a letter written to U.S. Secretary of State Daniel Webster.[9] ^ a b Clark was appointed on November 18;[10] it is unknown what specific date he assumed office. ^ a b Briggs was sworn into office 25 days before the state was formally admitted.[21] ^ There is no official numbering, and different governors have interpreted it differently, depending on if they give a new number when a governor has multiple distinct terms in office.[20] This article includes numbering for every distinct term in office. ^ The office of Lieutenant Governor was created in the 1857 constitution.[16] ^ Lieutenant governors represented the same party as their governor unless noted. ^ The election schedule changed with this term, switching to odd-numbered years and shortening the term by nearly a year. ^ First term under the 1857 constitution, which shortened terms to two years.[12] ^ No source appears to know which date Walden resigned, just that it was to take an elected seat in the United States House of Representatives for a term beginning March 4. ^ Kirkwood resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[22] ^ a b All sources state Boies was sworn in on February 27, 1890, with no explanation given for the delay; it appears from primary sources that the state legislature was deadlocked, performing over one hundred votes to name the speaker, and the certification of election results was delayed,[23] with Larrabee remaining in office until his successor was certified. ^ a b Represented the Republican Party ^ Cummins resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate. ^ The election schedule changed with this term, switching to odd-numbered years and lengthening the term by nearly a year. ^ a b c Represented the Democratic Party ^ Hughes resigned to take an elected seat in the United States Senate.[24] ^ First term under a 1972 constitutional amendment which lengthened terms to four years.[13] ^ Branstad resigned to become United States Ambassador to China.[25] ^ Reynolds' first full term began January 18, 2019, and will expire January 10, 2023. ^ Gregg was appointed acting lieutenant governor by Reynolds but, while he had the full powers and salary of the office, he was not in the line of succession; he later won election to the post in the 2018 election.
