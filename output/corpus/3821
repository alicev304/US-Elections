The two major party candidates were chosen at the Democratic National Convention and Republican National Convention in July 2016. Donald Trump won the general election of Tuesday, November 8, 2016, despite losing the popular vote while winning the electoral college.[1][2] Most polls correctly predicted a popular vote victory for Clinton, but overestimated the size of her lead, with the result that Trump's electoral college victory was a surprise to analysts. Retrospective analyses differ as to why the polls and commentators interpreting them were unable to correctly forecast the result of the election.[1][2] Two daily tracking polls, the UPI/CVoter poll and the University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll were the only polls that often incorrectly predicted a Trump popular vote victory or showed a nearly tied election.[3] Contents 1 Aggregate polls 2 Individual polls 2.1 Two-way race 2.1.1 After convention nominations 3 Graphical summaries 3.1 Polls conducted in 2016 3.2 Polls conducted in 2015 3.3 Polls conducted in 2014 3.4 Polls conducted in 2013 3.5 Three-way race 3.6 Four-way race 3.7 Five-way race 4 Post election analysis 5 See also 6 References Aggregate polls[edit] Poll numbers verified as of November 8, 2016[update].

analysis[edit] BBC News questioned whether polling should be abandoned due to its abject failure.[1] Forbes magazine contributor astrophysicist Ethan Siegel performed a scientific analysis and raised whether the statistical population sampled for the polling was inaccurate, and cited the cautionary adage "Garbage in, garbage out".[2] He concluded there may have been sampling bias on the part of the pollsters.[2] Siegel compared the 2016 election to the failure of prognosticator Arthur Henning in the "Dewey Defeats Truman" incident from the 1948 presidential election.[2] Despite all this, however, nationwide polling was not far off from the actual popular vote result, and in fact very few states had results that deviated from the margin of error in the polling average. A particular case was the USC/Los Angeles Times Daybreak tracking poll, which was different from other polls as it had Donald Trump in the lead more often than not.[631] The poll’s findings caused skepticism, especially from Democrats, who have denounced it and often criticized the LA Times for running it. Before the election, Nate Silver deemed as positive the poll allowed people to assign themselves a probability of voting for either candidate instead of saying they’re 100 percent sure and stated that if people are "going to browbeat a pollster, [let's] do it to a pollster who is doing things cheaply—some of the robopolls qualify—and not one that’s trying to move the ball forward, like the LA Times poll."[632] The LA Times concluded after the preliminary results of the election were published: "That doesn't necessarily mean that a poll conducted online, the way the Daybreak poll is, necessarily will be more accurate than polls conducted by phone. But it is yet another indication that polling needs more, diverse ways to look at public opinion, not fewer."[633] See also[edit] General election polling Nationwide opinion polling for the United States presidential election by demographics, 2016 Statewide opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016 International opinion polling for the United States presidential election, 2016 Democratic primary polling Nationwide opinion polling for the Democratic Party 2016 presidential primaries Statewide opinion polling for the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016 Republican primary polling Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2016 presidential primaries Statewide opinion polling for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016 After the election Opinion polling on the Donald Trump administration References[edit] ^ a b c Peter Barnes, Senior elections and political analyst, BBC News (11 November 2016), "Reality Check: Should we give up on election polling?", BBC News, retrieved 12 November 2016CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link) ^ a b c d e Ethan Siegel (9 November 2016), "The Science Of Error: How Polling Botched The 2016 Election", Forbes magazine, retrieved 12 November 2016 ^ http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/politics/Quick-Dirty-Guide-Polls-2016-Elections-396973901.html ^ "UPI/CVoter poll: Clinton holds slim lead over Trump in last poll before election day".
