List of governors of Washington From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Governor of Washington) Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Washington Seal of the Governor Incumbent Jay Inslee since January 16, 2013 Style Governor (informal) The Honorable (formal) Status Head of state Head of government Residence Washington Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, no term limit Inaugural holder Elisha P. Ferry Formation November 11, 1889 Deputy Lieutenant Governor of Washington Salary $166,891 (2014)[1] Website Official website The Governor of Washington is the head of the executive branch of the Government of the State of Washington and commander-in-chief of the state's military forces.[2][3] The officeholder has a duty to enforce state laws,[4] the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Washington Legislature and line-item veto power to cancel specific provisions in spending bills.[5] The Washington Governor may also convene the legislature on "extraordinary occasions".[4] Washington Territory had 14 territorial governors from its organization in 1853 until the formation of the state of Washington in 1889. Territorial governors were appointed by the President of the United States. Elisha Peyre Ferry had the longest term of eight years and went on to become the state's first governor. William H. Wallace was appointed governor but never took office due to being elected as the territory's congressional delegate. George E. Cole was appointed governor and took office, but his appointment was never ratified by the U.S. Senate and he was replaced as governor after four months. Twenty-two individuals have held the office of Governor of Washington since the state's admission to the Union, with Arthur B. Langlie serving non-consecutive terms. Langlie and Daniel J. Evans are the state's only three term governors. Populist Party candidate John Rankin Rogers is the only non-Democratic or Republican nominee to win office. The current governor is Democrat Jay Inslee, who took office on January 16, 2013 and was reelected in 2016; his term will expire on January 13, 2021. The last Republican to hold the office was John Spellman in 1985; Washington has had the longest streak of Democratic governors in the nation.[6][7][a] Contents 1 Governors 1.1 Governors of the Territory of Washington 1.2 Governors of the State of Washington 2 Succession 3 Other high offices held 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References 7 External links Governors[edit] Governors of the Territory of Washington[edit] For the period before Washington Territory was formed, see the List of Governors of Oregon Territory. Washington Territory was created on March 2, 1853 from the northern half of Oregon Territory. At this point, Washington Territory also included the northern panhandle of modern Idaho and parts of Montana.[8] The southern half of Idaho was assigned to the Washington Territory in 1859 after Oregon was admitted as a state.[9] Idaho Territory was split from Washington Territory in 1863 giving Washington Territory its final borders.[10] Due to the long distance between Washington, D.C. and Olympia, there was often a lengthy gap between a governor being appointed and his arrival in the territory.

The term for governor is four years,[2] commencing on the second Monday in the January following the election.[33] If the office of governor is vacant or the governor is unable to discharge their duties, the lieutenant governor assumes the office of governor. If both the offices of governor and lieutenant governor are unable to fulfill their duties, the secretary of state is next in line, and then the treasurer.[34] There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve.[35] The office of lieutenant governor is not elected on the same ticket as the governor.

Three represented Washington Territory as delegates to the U.S. House, and one additionally represented Idaho Territory in the same fashion, as well as serving as Governor of Idaho Territory. Two territorial governors represented eastern states, one as a representative from, and governor of, New Jersey, and one represented Virginia both in the United States and Confederate Houses. Three governors represented the state in the U.S. Senate, and two represented the state in the House. One governor has served in the United States Cabinet. Two of the territorial governors (marked with *) resigned their office to serve as territorial delegates.

The actual dates governors took office are sometimes vague; the ones in this list are cited mostly with contemporary news coverage, but other resources and almanacs give slightly different dates. ^ Received a leave of absence in May 1860 to move his wife from Texas to Kentucky. He never returned to Washington Territory.[16][17] ^ Appointed as governor, but did not take office as he was elected as a delegate from Washington Territory.[19] ^ a b President Johnson removed Governor Pickering in November 1866. Governor Cole arrived on January 8, 1867 after being appointed governor. Governor Pickering would not relinquish power until the U.S. Senate approved of Governor Cole's nomination on the basis that President Johnson was being impeached. However, the state's legislature looked to Governor Cole as the real governor. The U.S. Senate eventually failed to ratify his nomination.[22] ^ a b c Was a resident of Washington Territory at the time of appointment. This could have cut down on the time between appointment and taking office.[29] ^ The official numbering includes ten Democrats, 12 Republicans, and John Rogers, who served as both a Democrat and a Populist. Rogers' term is counted as both Populist and Democratic. ^ The fractional terms of some governors are not to be understood absolutely literally; rather, they are meant to show single terms during which multiple governors served, due to resignations, deaths and the like. ^ Rogers was elected as a Populist for his first term and a Democrat for his second.[36] ^ a b Died in office. ^ a b As lieutenant governor, filled unexpired term. ^ a b c Represented the Republican Party. ^ Lister became ill during his second term, relinquished his office to the Lieutenant Governor, and died a few months later.[37] ^ As lieutenant governor, Hart filled the unexpired term after Lister relinquished his office due to ill health.[37] ^ a b c d Represented the Democratic Party. ^ Inslee's second term expires in January 2021.
