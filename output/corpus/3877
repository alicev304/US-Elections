Brian T. Carroll is the party’s nominee in the 2020 presidential election. The ASP encourages social development along the lines of subsidiarity and sphere sovereignty, with a stated emphasis on "the importance of strong families, local communities, and voluntary associations".[10] They also have a stated policy of defending religious freedom.[3] The American Solidarity Party favors a social market economy,[8] and seeks "widespread economic participation and ownership" through supporting small business. They also call for providing a safety net.[3][2] In order to promote environmental stewardship and sustainability, the ASP platform calls for conservation and a transition toward more renewable sources of energy, while rejecting population control measures.[8][3] Contents 1 History 1.1 Early history 1.2 2016 presidential election 1.3 2017 New Jersey legislative election 1.4 2018 Thiensville, Wisconsin Village Board election 1.5 2018 California elections 1.5.1 Governor 1.5.2 U.S. House of Representatives District 22 1.5.3 San Diego City Council District 6 1.6 2019 Sheboygan, Wisconsin city attorney 1.7 2020 presidential election 2 Ideology and influences 3 Names and symbols 4 Notable party members 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History[edit] Early history[edit] The ASP was founded in 2011 as the "Christian Democratic Party USA".[6] In 2012, the CDPUSA endorsed the independent candidacy of Joe Schriner for President.[11] The name of the party was changed after the 2012 election to the "American Solidarity Party",[6] and a national committee was created for the purpose of drafting a platform and developing the party’s online presence. Kirk Morrison chaired the committee until late 2015. Dr. Stephen Beall, who drafted the original platform, became chair in 2016 and organized the party’s first online convention in July. He was succeeded by Matthew Bartko, who worked to incorporate the ASP as a legal entity and presided over the formation of numerous state chapters.[citation needed] ASP ballot status in 2016 On ballot Write-in Not on ballot 2016 presidential election[edit] During the 2016 presidential election season, the American Solidarity Party held an online convention on July 9, 2016, which nominated Dr. Amir Azarvan of Georgia for president and Mike Maturen of Michigan for vice-president.[12][13][14][15] However, Azarvan subsequently withdrew, and in response the ticket was revised, with Maturen running for president and Juan Muñoz of Texas running for vice-president.[16][17][12][18][15] For the 2016 election, the American Solidarity Party was listed on the ballot in Colorado.[19] It was a certified write-in option in Alabama,[20] California,[21] Georgia,[22] Iowa,[20] Kansas,[23] Kentucky,[24] Maryland,[25] Michigan,[26] Minnesota, New Hampshire,[20] New Jersey,[20] Ohio,[27] Oregon,[20][28] Pennsylvania,[20] Rhode Island,[20] Texas,[29] Vermont,[20] and Washington.[30] Maturen received 6,662 reported votes, not including states that didn't report votes for him.[31] 2017 New Jersey legislative election[edit] For the November 2017 off-year elections, the American Solidarity Party ran a candidate for New Jersey legislature, Monica Sohler, in the 6th district. She received 821 votes.[32] 2018 Thiensville, Wisconsin Village Board election[edit] Marianne Bovee ran for Thiensville, Wisconsin Village Board, receiving 155 votes (21.4%),[33] narrowly missing out by 5 votes.[34] ASP 2018 CA Gubernatorial Votes by County by Percentage 2018 California elections[edit] Governor[edit] Desmond Silveira, a software engineer, was formerly national committee member of the American Solidarity Party, the campaign manager for the Maturen-Muñoz 2016 campaign, vice chair of the ASP, and director of operations for the party. In 2018, he ran for governor, receiving 4,633 votes in the election.[35][36] U.S. House of Representatives District 22[edit] Brian T.

Carroll was declared the winner of the nomination in September 2019.[41] Name Born Experience Home state Running Mate Campaign Announcement date Ref.

The American Solidarity Party has been characterized as conservative on social issues while supporting some government intervention in economic matters.[44] The ASP's 2016 presidential nominee, Mike Maturen, has characterized the party as "centrist",[5] as has The Irish Times.[45] Membership and leadership in the American Solidarity Party is open to people of all backgrounds, creeds, etc. The American Solidarity Party adheres to the ideology of Christian democracy,[7] which has been influenced by Catholic Social Teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology.[46][47][7] As such, the ASP looks to the Christian Democratic movements in Europe and the Americas,[17] and to American religious populists such as Martin Luther King.[48] As the name indicates, the American Solidarity Party draws its inspiration from Solidarity (Polish trade union), founded by Lech Wałęsa in 1980. In addition, the ASP shares the socially conservative positions of the Netherlands' Anti-Revolutionary Party, founded by Dutch prime minister and Calvinist theologian Abraham Kuyper in 1879.[49] A core principle of the American Solidarity Party is the consistent life ethic, understood as “respect for life and the dignity of all persons on all issues.”[50] Like other social conservatives, the ASP opposes abortion, euthanasia, and embryonic stem cell research, but it differs from many of them by rejecting capital punishment and holding to Just War principles in foreign policy. It regards economic justice as an essential aspect of respect for human life.[51] The American Solidarity Party also calls for fair labor practices and the strengthening of labor organizations, a wider distribution of wealth and productive property, the provision of decent health care to all members of society, responsible stewardship of the environment, and policies that strengthen the family and civil society.[50] David McPherson of First Things says that the American Solidarity Party "affirm[s] ... the full spectrum of Catholic social teaching (namely, the teachings regarding the sanctity of human life, the common good, subsidiarity, religious freedom, solidarity, etc.)," contrasting the ASP to both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party, each of which recognizes only some of these items.[16] Its strongest support is in California, Ohio, and Texas, according to the Madera Tribune (of Madera, California).[17] Names and symbols[edit] The party was founded in 2011 as the Christian Democratic Party USA. Shortly after the 2012 election, the CDP USA renamed itself the American Solidarity Party.[2] The ASP mascot is the pelican, a traditional symbol of charity.[15] The party’s political color is orange, as with other Christian Democratic political parties. Some members of the American Solidarity Party refer to themselves as Solidarists.[52] Notable party members[edit] Fr.
