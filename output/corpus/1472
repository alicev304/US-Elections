Over the summer, £20 worth of Amazon vouchers are being given away every week for most stubs expanded, and there is a different region of focus each week. Editors now with more time to edit during the pandemic please help contribute and help us work towards expanding 50,000 stubs! Wikipedia:WikiProject COVID-19 has been formed to help develop and organize articles on the current pandemic. A newsletter about userscript development on Wikipedia has been created: Wikipedia:Scripts++. To subscribe, visit its mailing list. A project is under way to add short descriptions to all articles. This is mainly for the benefit of mobile users searching Wikipedia. Help is welcomed – please visit WikiProject Short descriptions to learn more. SearchSuite is a userscript that provides user control over search results: it can strip them down to a single-spaced list, sort, and more. Most of its features are presented as menu item toggles to turn each feature on/off. Feedback and feature suggestions welcome. Do you have need for a specialized script that doesn't exist yet, or have an idea for a cool new script or gadget? Post requests and ideas at Wikipedia:User scripts/Requests. Free subscriptions to high-quality paywalled journals, newspaper archives, and online reference works are available for Wikipedia editors. For more information, see Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library Projects seeking help Also consider posting WikiProject, Task Force, and Collaboration news at the Signpost's WikiProject Report page. WikiProjects and Task Forces The Wikipedia Help Project seeks assistance expanding and improving the Task Center and other pages within the Help namespace. WikiProject Houston is looking for editors who are interested in collaborating on articles relevant to the Houston area. Call for volunteers at WikiProject Biography, Assessment backlog.

Setting Wikipedia time to your time zone Wikipedia's servers record activity based on Coordinated Universal Time (UTC for short). You can set your user preferences to display time for the time zone you are in. If you do this, Wikipedia will show all times in Recent changes, page histories, and contribution histories based on your local time zone. However, when you sign a talk page with ~~~~, the timestamp is created in text, so it has to be displayed in UTC. Automated logs such as image file uploads are also shown in server time (UTC). To show other users what time zone you are in, you could even add a time userbox to your own user page.
