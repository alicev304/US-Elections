Under the United States Constitution, the manner of choosing electors for the Electoral College is determined by each state's legislature. Although each state designates electors by popular vote, other methods are allowed. For instance, instead of having a popular vote, a number of states used to select presidential electors by a direct vote of the state legislature itself.

However, federal law does specify that all electors must be selected on the same day, which is "the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November," i.e., a Tuesday no earlier than November{{nbsp}}2 and no later than November{{nbsp}}8.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sandy unlikely to postpone election|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2012/10/30/sandy-obama-romney-election/1668501/|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref> Today, the states and the District of Columbia each conduct their own popular elections on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] to help determine their respective slate of electors.

Generally, voters are required to vote on a ballot where they select the candidate of their choice. The presidential ballot is a vote "for the electors of a candidate" meaning the voter is not voting for the candidate, but endorsing a slate of electors pledged to vote for a specific presidential and vice presidential candidate.

Many voting ballots allow a voter to "blanket vote" for all candidates in a particular [[List of political parties in the United States|political party]] or to select individual candidates on a line by line voting system. Which candidates appear on the voting ticket is determined through a legal process known as [[Ballot access in the United States|ballot access]]. Usually, the size of the candidate's political party and the results of the major nomination conventions determine who is pre-listed on the presidential ballot. Thus, the presidential election ticket will not list every candidate running for president, but only those who have secured a major party nomination or whose size of their political party warrants having been formally listed. Laws are in effect to have other candidates pre-listed on a ticket, provided enough voters have endorsed that candidate, usually through a signature list.

The final way to be elected for president is to have one's name written in at the time of election as a [[write-in candidate]]. This is used for candidates who did not fulfill the legal requirements to be pre-listed on the voting ticket. It is also used by voters to express a distaste for the listed candidates, by writing in an alternative candidate for president such as [[Mickey Mouse]] or comedian [[Stephen Colbert]] (whose application was voted down by the South Carolina Democratic Party). In any event, a write-in candidate has never won an election for President of the United States.

Because U.S. territories are not represented in the Electoral College, U.S. citizens in those areas do not vote in the general election for president. [[Guam]] has held [[straw poll]]s for president since the 1980 election to draw attention to this fact.<ref name="guammove">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ballot-access.org/2008/07/10/guam-legislature-moves-general-election-presidential-vote-to-the-september-primary/ |title=Guam Legislature Moves General Election Presidential Vote to the September Primary |publisher=Ballot-Access.org |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2008-09-17}}</ref>
