Here’s how the Nevada caucuses work Our reporters provided real-time updates from Nevada and New York. Trip Gabriel, in New York Feb. 22, 2020 Lots of counting ahead, but with 1 in 3 precincts reporting in Clark County, home to 75% of the state population, final results may not be much different.

Jennifer Medina, in Las Vegas Feb. 22, 2020 Sanders won at five of seven caucus sites on the Las Vegas Strip, a clear sign that messages from Culinary Union leadership were largely ignored.

Jennifer Medina, in Las Vegas Feb. 22, 2020 For months, I’ve heard Sanders supporters complain that he’s not as well known among older Latinos. Seems that complaint should dissipate now. Nate Cohn, in New York Feb. 22, 2020 Sanders’s strength among Latinos is confirmed in the results by precinct. The more estimated Hispanic voters in a precinct, the better Sanders did.
