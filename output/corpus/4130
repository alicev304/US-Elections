Democratic committee member Jim Himes says that Simpson "did not provide evidence and I think that's an important point.

Weldon is a longtime friend of Artemenko, has ties to Vekselberg, and was involved with Artemenko's February 2017 peace plan.[401] Former Obama national security advisor Ben Rhodes writes in his new memoir that the Obama administration first learned of Flynn's December 2016 communications with Kislyak from Trump transition team members and not from "unmasking", as Nunes had alleged.[402] Paul Manafort and Konstantin Kilimnik superseding indictment June 8, 2018 June 8 Mueller files new obstruction charges against Paul Manafort and his associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, for witness tampering. The indictment alleges Manafort and Kilimnik coached witnesses on their stories for Manafort's ongoing criminal cases.[403] The two witnesses mentioned in the indictment are Alan Friedman (as "Person D1"), and Eckart Sager (as "Person D2").[179] In September, Manafort pleads guilty to the witness tampering charge.[178][404] Mueller's grand jury in Washington, D.C., questions Andrii Artemenko for several hours about his interactions with Cohen.[405] An unsolicited memo from former U.S. attorney general William Barr arrives at the Justice Department. The memo details Barr's views on the Mueller investigation and his legal theory that the president cannot be charged with obstruction of justice unless he is involved in the explicit destruction of evidence. Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel Steven Engel tells Justice Department staff that he invited Barr for a brown bag lunch with the department on June 27. Engel and his office are responsible for providing the White House with legal opinions and answering their legal questions, but do not provide personal legal advice.

The two are Alan Friedman and Eckart Sager. Both are PR executives at FBC Media and former journalists. The documents are quickly replaced by redacted versions.[410] June 14: DOJ-OIG Report. (June 14, 2018) The Washington Post reports that Trump and his allies recently launched a public relations campaign to discredit Cohen in case he starts cooperating with the Mueller investigation. The thrust of the campaign is to argue that Cohen will fabricate any compromising evidence he voluntarily hands over to Mueller's team in order to please Mueller.[411] The Department of Justice Inspector General releases a report on FBI and DOJ actions in the 2016 election. The report discusses the contentions between the Trump-Russia investigation and the Clinton email investigation.[412][413] June 15: U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson revokes Paul Manafort's bail for abusing the trust the court placed in him when bail was originally granted. The judge orders Manafort to be jailed.[414][415] U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich rejects Russian-owned Concord Management and Consulting's request that she examine the instructions provided to the grand jury. Concord accused Mueller's prosecutors of giving faulty instructions, tainting the grand jury's decision to approve charges.[416] Mueller's team interviews Gerson the last of two times.[29]:147, 157–159 Trump tells[417] a press gaggle at the White House that it is "irrelevant" whether he dictated his son's July 2017 statement on the Trump Tower meeting, saying, "It's a statement to the New York Times.... That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges."[9]:105 Giuliani gives a series of interviews[418][415] in which he raises the possibility of Trump pardoning Manafort.[9]:124-125 June 17: The Washington Post reports that in May 2016 Stone and Caputo met in Miami with a Russian national who reportedly called himself "Henry Greenberg" and, according to Greenberg, a Ukrainian friend Greenberg identified as "Alexei". Caputo and Stone were offered political dirt on Hillary Clinton. The Post's 2018 story is the first time Stone admits to knowingly meeting with any Russian nationals in 2016.[419] Greenberg also goes by the name "Henry Oknyansky".[420][421] Giuliani tells Jake Tapper on CNN that his and Trump's comments on possible pardons should not be taken as warnings that the possible recipients should not cooperate in criminal prosecutions.[9]:124-125[422] June 18: Lawyers for Andrew Miller, a former associate of Roger Stone, challenge in court a subpoena he received for information about Stone, WikiLeaks, "Guccifer 2.0", "DCLeaks", and Julian Assange. Miller's lawyer Alicia Dearn asserts at the hearing that Miller had asked for immunity regarding political action committee transactions involving himself and Stone.[423] Christopher Steele is deposed in London by lawyers for Aleksej Gubarev. Gubarev is seeking information on the Steele dossier to help his libel suit against BuzzFeed.[424] June 20: Mueller's team interviews Dearborn for the second and final time.[9]:91–93 June 21: U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson rejects a motion to suppress evidence found in a search of Manafort's storage locker on May 27, 2017. The defense argued the evidence was improperly collected because the FBI entered the locker without a search warrant, even though the FBI left and returned with a warrant after seeing the locker's contents. The judge ruled the evidence was properly collected because the Manafort associate who opened the locker was on the lease, had a key, and voluntarily let the FBI in.[425] June 22: Judge Jackson rejects a request to toss out a money laundering charge against Manafort. His lawyers argued that receiving tens of millions of dollars for lobbying while an unregistered foreign agent was not illegal in itself. Instead, they argued, failing to register was the illegal act. The judge ruled, "It is a crime to 'act' [as a foreign agent] 'unless' one has registered – the statute does not simply state that the failure to register is unlawful[.]"[426] June 24: Credico tells Jimmy Dore that he received a request from Mueller for a voluntary interview. Credico tells The Daily Beast that he will refuse to speak to Mueller's team unless he is subpoenaed.[427] June 25: ABC News reports that Erik Prince gave Mueller's team "total access to his phones and computer."[428] Mueller's team interviews Trump campaign policy director John Mashburn.[29]:125-127 June 27: The Office of Legal Counsel holds a brown-bag lunch at the Department of Justice with William Barr as featured speaker.

Res 970 subpoenaing FISA surveillance on a party line vote with Congressman Justin Amash voting present.[429] June 30: The federal judge overseeing the Concord Management and Consulting case rejects the defense attorneys' request to share evidence with co-defendant Yevgeniy Prigozhin, which they insisted was critical to their defense.
