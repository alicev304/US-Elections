After tracing the emergence of the Internet in presidential campaigns since 1996, three functions of the Internet during the 2008 primary campaigns are examined. First, Democratic candidates employed their Web sites to create ideological unity, involvement, and commitment among their supporters and as a foundation for a new source of campaign funding, especially among small donors. Second, the Internet provides a foundation for tracking, if not predicting, the success of specific candidates at different stages in the campaign process. Third, while only an emergent force, the Internet increasingly appears to be functioning as an independent, if not discrete, sociopolitical system with unique modes of interaction, its own rules and procedures, and ultimately its own standards and guidelines for presidential campaigns. It is concluded that while the Internet can be usefully viewed strategically as an instrument to be manipulated by political candidates, it may be appropriate to also examine the Internet as a unique and discrete social system with its own ethos, pathos, and logos.

Notes A similar kind of saturation can emerge from digital technology system when “robo-calls” are employed by political campaigns; see: Pew Research Center, April 3, 2008 Pew Research Center . ( 2008, January 11 ). The Internet's broader role in campaign 2008 . Retrieved January 17, 2008, from http://pewresearch.org [Google Scholar] (also, see: Belson, 2008 Belson , K. ( 2008, July 16 ). For half a cent, a call that informs, and annoys . The New York Times , pp. A1 and A17 . [Google Scholar]). Perhaps the most powerful example of the meaning of “user generated” content occurs when it has been contrasted to event-driven content reflected in traditional television network programs; see: Kohut (1998 Kohut , A. ( 1998, June 8 ). Event-driven news audiences: Internet news takes off . Retrieved June 20, 1998, from http://www.pewresearch.org [Google Scholar]) and Project for Excellence in Journalism (2007 Project for Excellence in Journalism . ( 2007, September 12 ). The latest news headlines—Your vote counts . Retrieved July 15, 2008, from http://www.journalism.org [Google Scholar]). If we seriously adopt this “two world reality” as a foundation for an analysis, it would be conceivable to think of the two primary Democratic political candidates, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, solely in terms of a computer metaphor. Within this context, Cohen (2008 Cohen , N. ( 2008, February 4 ). Is Obama a Mac and Clinton a PC? The New York Times , p. C3 . [Google Scholar]) has suggested that “The difference between hillaryclinton.com and barackobama.com can be summed up this way: Barack Obama is a Mac, and Hillary Clinton is a PC.” Article Metrics Views 475 Citations Crossref 8 Web of Science 0 Scopus 10 Altmetric Article metrics information Disclaimer for citing articles More Share Options Browse journals by subject Back to top Area Studies Arts Behavioral Sciences Bioscience Built Environment Communication Studies Computer Science Development Studies Earth Sciences Economics, Finance, Business & Industry Education Engineering & Technology Environment & Agriculture Environment and Sustainability Food Science & Technology Geography Health and Social Care Humanities Information Science Language & Literature Law Mathematics & Statistics Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing & Allied Health Museum and Heritage Studies Physical Sciences Politics & International Relations Social Sciences Sports and Leisure Tourism, Hospitality and Events Urban Studies Information for Authors Editors Librarians Societies Open access Overview Open journals Open Select Cogent OA Help and info Help & contact Newsroom Commercial services All journals Keep up to date Register to receive personalised research and resources by email Sign me up Taylor and Francis Group Facebook page Taylor and Francis Group Twitter page Taylor and Francis Group Linkedin page Taylor and Francis Group Youtube page Taylor and Francis Group Weibo page Copyright © 2020 Informa UK Limited Privacy policy Cookies Terms & conditions Accessibility Registered in England & Wales No. 3099067 5 Howick Place | London | SW1P 1WG Accept We use cookies to improve your website experience.
