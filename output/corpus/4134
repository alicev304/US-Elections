Trump & Son. Donald Trump began leading it in 1971, renamed it around 1973, and handed off its leadership to his children in 2017. The Trump Organization, through its various constituent companies and partnerships, has or has had interests in real estate development, investing, brokerage, sales and marketing, and property management. Trump Organization entities own, operate, invest in, and develop residential real estate, hotels, resorts, residential towers, and golf courses in various countries.[5][6][7] They also operate or have operated in construction, hospitality, casinos, entertainment, book and magazine publishing, broadcast media, model management, retail, financial services, food and beverages, business education, online travel, commercial and private aviation and beauty pageants.[8][9] Trump Organization entities also own the New York television production company that produced the reality television franchise The Apprentice.[10] Retail operations include or have included fashion apparel, jewelry and accessories, books, home furnishings, lighting products, bath textiles and accessories, bedding, home fragrance products, small leather goods, vodka, wine, barware, steaks, chocolate bars, and bottled spring water.[11] Since the financial statements of the Trump Organization's holdings and Donald Trump's personal tax returns are both private, its true value is not publicly known, though a wide range of estimates have been made. Trump has publicly released little definitive financial documentation to confirm his valuation claims.[12][13] On several occasions, Trump has been accused of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through aggressive lobbying of the media (in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list) to bolster his perceived net worth.[14] Contents 1 History 1.1 Founding and early history 1.2 Leadership under Donald Trump 1.3 Trump presidency 2 Real estate 2.1 Selected completed properties 2.2 Carousel 2.3 Skating rinks 2.4 Trump Winery 2.5 Golf courses 2.5.1 United States 2.5.2 International 2.6 Real estate licensing 2.7 Former licensees 2.8 Former properties 2.9 Scion and American Idea hotels 3 Other ventures and investments 4 Coats of arms 5 Valuation disputes 6 Controversies 7 See also 8 References 9 Further reading 10 External links History[edit] Founding and early history[edit] An early logotype of the Trump Organization, as it appeared in 1976 correspondence from Donald Trump to the Penn Central Transportation Company The company's background starts with Frederick Trump and Elizabeth Christ Trump, a German immigrant couple who moved to the borough of Queens in 1906. Frederick began developing real estate there. On 30 May 1918, however, he died of Spanish flu in the 1918 influenza pandemic, leaving an estate valued at $31,359 (or about $345,000 in 1999 dollars).[15] Elizabeth carried on in the real estate business after her husband's death. She had contractors build houses on the empty lots Frederick had owned, sold the houses, and lived off the mortgage payments.[16] Her vision was to have her three children continue the family business.[16] Her middle child, Fred Trump, began construction of his first house in 1923, soon after graduating high school.[17] Elizabeth partially financed Fred's houses,[18] and held the business in her name because Fred had not reached the age of majority.[17] They did business as "E. Trump & Son", building hundreds of houses in Queens over the next several years.[19][a] E. Trump & Son went out of business during the Great Depression.[26] Fred Trump next opened a supermarket, but quickly sold it and returned to the real estate business by 1933.[27][28] Fred Trump became a prolific builder of single-family homes in Queens and Brooklyn.[29] During World War II he constructed apartments and temporary housing for military personnel in Virginia and Pennsylvania.[29] In 1944, he shifted his focus back to Brooklyn and began planning to develop large apartment buildings.[30] He opened the 1,344-unit Shore Haven complex in 1949,[31] followed by Beach Haven in 1950[32] and Trump Village in 1964.[33] Elizabeth remained involved in the family business throughout her life. Even in her 70s, she collected coins from the laundromats in the Trump buildings.[16] Leadership under Donald Trump[edit] Donald Trump worked for his father's business while attending the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1968 officially joined the company.[34] In the early 1970s, Donald was made president of the company, while Fred became chairman of the board.[35] Around 1973, Donald began referring to the business, which had previously had no single formal name, as the Trump Organization.[b] Donald Trump focused his efforts on major development projects in Manhattan, including the renovation of the Commodore Hotel, in partnership with Hyatt, as the Grand Hyatt New York (opened in 1980);[41] the construction of Trump Tower in partnership with The Equitable (1983);[42] and the development of Trump Plaza (1984).[43][44] He also opened three casino hotels in Atlantic City, New Jersey: Trump Plaza (1984),[45] Trump Castle (1985),[46] and Trump Taj Mahal (1990).[47] In 1990, the Trump Organization approached a financial crisis and was believed to be on the brink of collapse, with Donald Trump and his companies owing estimated debts of $3.4 billion.[48] Trump hired Stephen Bollenbach as the company's first chief financial officer, while Allen Weisselberg continued to serve under him as controller.[49][50] Trump spent the following years renegotiating his debts, and gave up some properties, including the Trump Shuttle airline and a stake in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.[51] Bollenbach left the company in 1992.[52] In 1995, Trump took another major step towards financial stability, launching a publicly traded company for the Trump casinos, Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts.[51][53] By 1996, Trump was widely considered to be making a comeback.[51][54] The casino company did not fare as well, however, and Trump eventually lost his stake in the company to bankruptcy.[55][56] In 1997, Fred Trump transferred ownership of the bulk of his portfolio of apartment buildings to his four surviving children (Donald, Robert, Maryanne, and Elizabeth).[57] Fred died in 1999.[32] In 2004, the four siblings sold the apartments for $700 million to a group led by Rubie Schron, marking the family's exit from ownership of their father's business.[58][59][60] Trump presidency[edit] Donald Trump relinquished his role in the Trump Organization after the 2016 election.[61] On January 11, 2017, he announced that he and his daughter Ivanka would fully resign and his sons Donald Jr. and Eric would take executive charge of the various businesses, along with Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Allen Weisselberg.[62] Trump retained his financial stake in the business, despite having offered during the campaign to put all his assets in a "blind trust" should he win the presidency.[63][64] His attorney at the time, Sheri Dillon, said Trump's assets would be overseen by an ethics officer, and that the Trump Organization would not pursue any new foreign business deals.[65] Under the pre-inaugural management agreement, Forbes magazine reported in March 2017: The Trump Organization has curtailed some of its international work, pulling out of deals in Azerbaijan, Georgia and Brazil, while pledging to do no new foreign deals (though it has apparently resurrected an old deal in the Dominican Republic). Trump's international hotel licensing and management business makes up only $220 million of his estimated $3.5 billion fortune, but it's the most dynamic part of the Trump portfolio—and it throws off chunks of cash with virtually no risk. As the Trumps have wound down some international deals, they continue to push forward with new domestic agreements. Eric Trump, in the Forbes article, discussed the "clear separation of church and state that we maintain" between the business and his father and said that with his father's presidency and related changes "[y]ou could look at it either way" in terms of business prospects. He also said that "he will continue to update his father on the business while he is in the presidency ... 'probably quarterly ... profitability reports and stuff like that'." The article quoted Larry Noble, general counsel of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center and a former chief ethics officer at the Federal Election Commission, and President George W. Bush's former chief ethics lawyer, Richard Painter, as looking negatively at such multiple planned updates of President Trump per year.[66] Noble said in part "if he is now going to get reports from his son about the businesses, then he really isn't separate in any real way." Painter said in part "at the end of the day, he owns the business. He has the conflicts that come with it."[66] Also in March 2017, Forbes did a listing of all "36 mini-Trumps", as it termed the domestic and international partners—often described as "billionaires"—with whom the Trump Organization has worked over the years. Introducing the listing, the magazine reported that at least 14 of the partners attended the president's inauguration and some of them paid for $18,000-a-night accommodations at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., for the event.[67] Real estate[edit] Map highlights countries with properties that are either owned or licensed by the Trump Organization as of December 2016.[68][69] As of 2019, Trump's net worth (as estimated by Forbes Magazine) is $3.1 billion, with about half of that coming from his New York City real estate holdings, and about a third coming from his national and international properties (including hotels and golf courses).[70] Licensing fees paid by outside owners for using Trump's name on their properties also contribute to his overall net worth[71][72] Selected completed properties[edit] The Trump World Tower at United Nations Plaza The Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City) at Columbus Circle Trump Tower, 725 Fifth Avenue, Midtown Manhattan: A 58-story[73] mixed-use tower, the headquarters of the Trump Organization, was developed in partnership with The Equitable, and opened in 1983. Trump bought out the Equitable's stake in 1986,[74] and now owns the office and retail components of the tower.[75] The building also contains the three-story penthouse apartment that was Donald Trump's primary residence until he moved to the White House.[76] The value of the tower was estimated at $450 million in 2017.[77] Trump took out a $100 million mortgage on the building in 2012.[75] Trump World Tower, 845 United Nations Plaza, also in Midtown Manhattan: In 2006, Forbes magazine estimated "$290 million in profits and unrealized appreciation" going to Trump.[78] AXA Financial Center in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco: Trump owns a 30 percent stake in these two office buildings, resulting from a property swap involving Riverside South. Trump's stake in the two buildings was estimated to be at least $850 million as of 2013[update].[75] The Trump Building at 40 Wall Street: Trump bought and renovated this building for $1 million in 1995. The pre-tax net operating income at the building as of 2011[update] was $20.89 million and is valued at $350 million to $400 million, according to the New York Department of Finance. Trump took out a $160 million mortgage attached to the property with an interest rate of 5.71% to use for other investments.[75] Forbes valued the property at $260 million in 2006.[78] Trump International Hotel and Tower Chicago: The entire project is valued at $1.2 billion ($112 million stake for Trump). Trump International Hotel Las Vegas: A joint development with fellow Forbes 400 members, Phil Ruffin ("key partner"), and Jack Wishna ("minority partner").[79] In 2006, Trump's stake was estimated at $162 million.[78] In Forbes in March 2017, the Trump International Las Vegas was described as a 50-50 partnership between Donald Sr. and Ruffin, with Eric as the primary manager for the Trump Organization.[66] Trump International Hotel and Tower New York: Trump provided his name and expertise to the building's owner (GE) during the building's re-development in 1994 for a fee totaling $40 million ($25 million for project management and $15 million in incentives deriving from the condo sales).

The property was worth as much as $250 million as of 2013[update].[75] Trump also owns two neighboring private houses, valued at $6.5 million and $3 million.[75] Seven Springs: A 213-acre (86 ha) estate with a 13-bedroom mansion near Bedford, New York. Trump paid $7.5 million for the property in 1995.[85] Local brokers put the property's value at around $40 million as of 2013[update].[75] Trump had hoped to develop the land with a golf course or houses, but apparently abandoned those plans in 2015.[85] Beverly Hills house: A 5-bedroom home purchased by Trump in 2007 for $7 million,[86] and valued at $8.5 to $10 million as of 2013[update].[75] Trump International Hotel Washington, D.C.: The Old Post Office Pavilion, historically known as the Old Post Office and Clock Tower, is a property located at 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.

In 2010, Trump took over the management of the carousel, where he promised to revive the merry-go-round after its previous operator was removed by the city's parks department. The carousel generates $589,000 from annual admissions.[87][88][89] The Trump Organization has a contract to operate the carousel through 2021.[90] Skating rinks[edit] Wollman Rink, Central Park The Trump Organization operates the Wollman and Lasker rinks, both in Central Park, jointly with Rink Management Services of Mechanicsville, Virginia.[91][92] In 1986, Trump offered New York City mayor Ed Koch to rebuild the deteriorating Wollman Rink at his expense within six months in return for the leases to operate the rink and an adjacent restaurant to recoup his costs.[93][94] The work was completed two months ahead of schedule and $750,000 under the estimated costs.[93][95] As part of the agreement to keep operating Wollman Rink, Trump agreed to also take a concession for the Lasker Rink as well, and the Trump Organization won concessions for the rinks in 1987.[96] The Trump Organization and Rink Management Services won the concessions to operate both rinks when the concessions were renewed in 2001. The Trump name is prominently displayed on the walls of the Wollman Rink as well as on the Zamboni that maintains it. It generates close to $8.7 million in annual income from rink admissions.[97][87][88] The Trump Organization has a contract to operate the rinks through 2021.[90] Trump Winery[edit] Trump Winery is a winery situated on Trump Vineyard Estates near Charlottesville, Virginia. It is valued between $5 million to $25 million.[97] The vineyard was purchased by Trump in April 2011 from Patricia Kluge, the widow of John Kluge. The property was distressed.[98] and was officially opened in October 2011.[99] Trump Winery is situated in the Monticello Wine Trail.

Some of his external entrepreneurial and investment ventures include or have included: Trump Financial (mortgage firm) Trump Sales and Leasing (residential sales) Trump International Realty (residential and commercial real estate brokerage firm) The Trump Entrepreneur Initiative (for profit business education company, formerly called Trump University)[1] Trump Restaurants (located in Trump Tower and consisting of Trump Buffet, Trump Catering, Trump Ice Cream Parlor, and Trump Bar) GoTrump.com (former online travel search engine)[153][154] Select By Trump (line of coffee drinks)[155] Trump Drinks (energy drink for the Israeli and Palestinian markets)[1][156] Donald J. Trump Signature Collection (a line of menswear, men's accessories, and watches) Donald Trump The Fragrance (2004) SUCCESS by Donald Trump (second fragrance launched by the Trump Organization and the Five Star Fragrance Company, released in March 2012) Trump Ice (line of bottled water) the former Trump Magazine[157] Trump Golf Trump Chocolate Trump Home (home furnishings)[81] Trump Productions (television production company) Trump Institute Trump: The Game (1989 board game with a 2004 re-release version tied to The Apprentice)[154] Donald Trump's Real Estate Tycoon (business-simulation game) Trump Books Trump Model Management Trump Realty Trump Shuttle Trump Mortgage Trump Vodka[81][158] Trump Steakhouse[153][159] Trump Steaks[154] In addition, Trump reportedly receives $1.5 million for each one-hour presentation he does for The Learning Annex.[160][161] Trump also endorsed ACN Inc. a multi-level marketing telecommunications company. He has spoken at ACN International Training Events at which he has praised the company's founders, business model and video phone.[162] He earned a total $1.35 million for three speeches given for the company amounting to $450,000 per speech.[163][164] The Trump Organization also houses ventures started by Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka, which includes Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry (a jewelry line) and the Ivanka Trump Lifestyle Collection (a high-end designer-fashion and cosmetics line that includes fragrances, footwear, handbags, outerwear and eyewear collections).[165] Coats of arms[edit] See also: List of personal coats of arms of Presidents of the United States Donald Trump has used a number of logos in the style of coats of arms for his businesses. The coat of arms granted to Davies in 1939 bears the motto "Integritas". Joseph E. Davies, third husband of Marjorie Merriweather Post and a former U.S. ambassador of Welsh origins, was granted a coat of arms by British heraldic authorities in 1939. After Donald Trump purchased Mar-a-Lago, the Florida estate built by Merriweather Post, in 1985, the Trump Organization started using Davies's coat of arms at Trump golf courses and estates across the country.[166] It was also registered with the U.S. patent and trademark office.[167] In 2008, Trump attempted to establish the American logo at his new Trump International Golf Links in Balmedie, Scotland, but was warned by the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the highest authority for Scottish heraldry, that an act of the Scottish Parliament from 1672 disallows people using unregistered arms. In January 2012, shortly after the inauguration of the golf course, Trump unveiled the new coat of arms[168] that had been granted to "The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd" by the Lord Lyon in 2011.[169] The coat of arms granted to "The Trump International Golf Club Scotland Ltd" in 2011 bears the battle cry: "Nunquam Concedere". Sarah Malone, executive vice-president of "The Trump International Golf Links, Scotland", said that "the coat of arms brings together visual elements that signify different aspects of the Trump family heritage [...], the Lion Rampant [in the crest] makes reference to Scotland and the stars to America. Three chevronels are used to denote the sky, sand dunes and sea—the essential components of the site, and the double-[headed] Eagle represents the dual nature and nationality of Trump's heritage (Scottish and German). The Eagle clutches golf balls making reference to the great name of golf, and the motto Numquam Concedere is Latin for Never Give Up—Trump's philosophy."[168] From 2014, Trump used the same logo for "The Trump International Golf Links, Ireland", the golf resort built from his acquisition of Doonbeg Golf Club.[170][171] Coat of arms used at Trump golf courses in Scotland and Ireland Shield Party per chevron: Azure two Mullets Argent; Vert a double headed Eagle displayed of the second, beaked, taloned and langued Gules, holding in its talons two Globes of the second; overall three chevronels Or.[172] Crest A demi Lion rampant Gules, armed and langued Azure, holding in the paws a Pennon Or flowing to the sinister. Battle cry "Numquam concedere" (Latin for "Never Give Up"). Valuation disputes[edit] The financial statements of the Trump Organization's holdings are private, as are Donald Trump's personal tax returns, and there exist a wide range of estimates of the Trump Organization's true value. Donald Trump has been accused on several occasions of deliberately inflating the valuation of Trump Organization properties through the aggressive lobbying of the media, in particular the authors of the annual Forbes 400 list, in order to bolster his perceived net worth among the public over several decades.[14] He has released little definitive financial documentation to the public confirm his valuation claims.[12][13][173][174] It is difficult to determine a net value for the Trump Organization's real estate holdings independently since each individual property may be encumbered by debt.[14] In October 2015, Forbes published an article titled "Inside The Epic Fantasy That's Driven Donald Trump For 33 Years" detailing its struggle to estimate the true net worth of Trump and the Trump Organization.[175] In 2018 a former Forbes journalist who had worked on the Forbes list claimed in an op-ed to The Washington Post that Trump had lied about his wealth to Forbes to get on the list repeatedly and suggested that Forbes' previous low-end estimates of Trump's net worth were still well above his true net worth.[14] Controversies[edit] In 1973, the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Civil Rights Division filed a civil rights suit against the Trump Organization charging them for violating the 1968 Fair Housing Act by refusing to rent to black people. The National Urban League had sent black and white testers to apply for apartments in Trump-owned complexes; the white people got the apartments, whereas the black peoples did not. According to court records, four superintendents or rental agents reported that applications sent to the central office for acceptance or rejection were coded by race. A 1979 Village Voice article quoted a rental agent who said Fred Trump had instructed him not to rent to black people and to encourage existing black tenants to leave. In 1975, a consent decree described by the head of DOJ's housing division as "one of the most far-reaching ever negotiated" required Trump to advertise vacancies in minority papers and list vacancies with the Urban League. The Justice Department subsequently stated that continuing "racially discriminatory conduct by Trump agents has occurred with such frequency that it has created a substantial impediment to the full enjoyment of equal opportunity."[176] Also, it is alleged that the Trump Organization has a history of not paying for services rendered. Several hundred contractors or workers for the organization have filed lawsuits or liens saying they were not paid for their work, and others say they had to settle for cents on the dollar.[177] In 1989, New York State officials ordered the Grand Hyatt New York, a hotel owned at the time by the Trump Organization and the Hyatt Corporation, to pay New York City $2.9 million in rent that had been withheld by the hotel in 1986 due to "unusual" accounting changes approved by Donald Trump.[178] An investigation by New York City auditors noted that the hotel was missing basic financial records and found the hotel was using procedures that violated generally accepted accounting principles. From 2000 on, the Trump Organization held 50% of TD Trump Deutschland AG, a corporate venture with a German company, planning to build a skyscraper named "Trump Tower Europe" in Frankfurt, Berlin or Stuttgart, but allegedly never paid the full amount of their €2 million share.[179] At least three lawsuits followed and the company was disestablished in 2005.[180] Turkish Prime Minister Erdoğan attended the opening of the Trump Towers Istanbul AVM in 2012. In December 2015, Trump said in a radio interview that he had a "conflict of interest" in dealing with Turkey and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan because of his Trump Towers Istanbul, saying "I have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul and it's a tremendously successful job ... It's called Trump Towers—two towers instead of one ... I've gotten to know Turkey very well."[181] As of August 2017[update],[182] Tom Scharfeld owns the trademark of "iTrump" mobile app which plays the trumpet. As "the word trump has other meanings",[183][184][185] the Court did not rule in favour of the Trump Organization. On March 15, 2018, the New York Times reported that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, as part of his inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, had previously issued a subpoena for documents from the Trump Organization. Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization, said: "Since July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and is responding to their requests."[186] In August 2018, the New York County district attorney was reported to be considering criminal charges against the organization and two of its senior executives regarding the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels.[187] In October 2018, The New York Times published an exposé arguing that the Trump family evaded over $500 million in gift taxes and estate taxes on the transfer of Fred Trump's wealth to his children. The alleged schemes involved siphoning money from Fred's companies to his children throughout their lives, and understating the value of transferred properties.[57] The Trump family denied the allegations.[57] New York tax authorities opened an investigation into the matter.[188] In December 2018, there were reports of Saudi Arabia's using Trump businesses to indirectly funnel funds to Donald Trump, which may be in breach of the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution.[189] After former Trump Organization attorney Michael Cohen testified to the House Oversight Committee in February 2019 that the company had inflated its asset values to insurance companies, the New York State Department of Financial Services issued a subpoena to Aon, the Trump Organization's longtime insurance broker.[190] The Trump Organization is under investigation by the Southern District of New York regarding inflated insurance claims allegations, as of May 2019.[191] See also[edit] Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2019–2020) References[edit] Footnotes ^ Some modern sources, including Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal, refer to the company as "Elizabeth Trump & Son".[20][21] Contemporaneous sources, however, refer to it as "E. Trump & Son".[22][23] The company was incorporated in 1927,[24] but the name was in use at least as early as 1926.[25] ^ Donald Trump says in The Art of the Deal that he began using the Trump Organization name during conversations with Victor Palmieri which began in 1973.[36] However, the name was used in at least one advertisement as early as 1972.[37] In prior decades, the business had occasionally been referred to as the Fred Trump Organization or the Fred C. Trump Organization.[38][39][40] Citations ^ a b Abelson, Max (September 3, 2015). "How Trump Invented Trump". Bloomberg Business. Archived from the original on June 22, 2016.
