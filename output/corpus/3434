How to submit an Op-Ed essay – Help
HOME Help | Account | Contact Help Our newsroom and editorial processes Editorial concerns How to submit an Op-Ed essay The New York Times accepts opinion essays on any topic for both the daily print page and online section as well as the Sunday Review, the International edition (which is edited out of London and Hong Kong), and other themed series. Published pieces typically run from 400 to 1,200 words, but drafts of any length within bounds of reason will be considered. We ask that everyone include a one-sentence author ID at the top or bottom of the submission. Please do not assume we are going to know who you are. Also, be sure to include annotations for all assertions and attributions made in your essay. All submissions must be original, exclusive to The Times and, as a matter of security, embedded in the text of an email, not as an attachment. Submissions may be sent to opinion@nytimes.com. Unfortunately, because of the large volume of messages we receive, we have to pass on much material of value and interest. If you do not hear from us within three business days, you should feel free to offer it elsewhere. What, exactly, is an Op-Ed? As Trish Hall, the former Op-Ed and Sunday Review editor has written, "Anything can be an Op-Ed.” Personal or explanatory essays, commentary on news events, reflections on cultural trends and more are all welcome. We're interested in anything well-written with a fact-based viewpoint we believe readers will find worthwhile. Can't find what you're looking for?
