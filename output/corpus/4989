Alaska voters chose electors to represent them in the Electoral College via a popular vote pitting the Republican Party's nominee, businessman Donald Trump, and running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence against Democratic Party nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her running mate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine. Alaska voters expressed their preferences for the Democratic presidential nomination in caucuses on March 26. They expressed their preferences for the Republican presidential nomination in caucuses on March 1. Donald Trump won the election in Alaska with 51.28% of the vote. Hillary Clinton received 36.55% of the vote.[1] This marked a return to Alaska's streak of giving Democrats under 40% of the vote after Barack Obama won just over 40% in 2012. Alaska has voted Republican in every election since 1968, and since its admission to the Union in 1959, it has only voted for the Democratic candidate on one occasion: President Lyndon B. Johnson's win in 1964. The state is known for supporting third parties, including Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson in the 2012 election, in which Alaska was his third-strongest state. He reran as the Libertarian Party's nominee for the 2016 election and appeared on the ballot in Alaska, garnering 5.88% of the vote, making Alaska again his third strongest state after New Mexico and North Dakota.[2] Johnson's performance was the best for a Libertarian since 1980 and the best third party performance since Ralph Nader in 2000.

Defeating the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, with 52.9% of the popular vote and 68% of the electoral vote,[3][4] Obama succeeded two-term Republican President George W. Bush, the former Governor of Texas. Obama and Biden were reelected in the 2012 presidential election, defeating former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney with 51.1% of the popular vote and 61.7% of electoral votes.[5] Although Barack Obama's approval rating in the RealClearPolitics poll tracking average remained between 40 and 50 percent for most of his second term, it has experienced a surge in early 2016 and reached its highest point since 2012 during June of that year.[6][7] Analyst Nate Cohn has noted that a strong approval rating for President Obama would equate to a strong performance for the Democratic candidate, and vice versa.[8] Following his second term, President Obama was not eligible for another reelection. In October 2015, Obama's running-mate and two-term Vice President Biden decided not to enter the race for the Democratic presidential nomination either.[9] With their term expiring on January 20, 2017, the electorate is asked to elect a new president, the 45th president and 48th vice president of the United States, respectively. Political landscape in Alaska[edit] Main article: Political party strength in Alaska The state of Alaska has given its electoral votes to the Republican ticket in every election year since 1968 and only once to a Democratic ticket since statehood. However, in 2012, it had the largest swing in favor of the Democratic Party with President Obama only losing by 14 points compared to his 2008 loss by 22 points.[10] Alaska also has a history of supporting third-party candidates at the presidential level. Alaska was the second-best state for Ross Perot in the 1992 election, with Ross Perot garnering 28% of the vote. Alaska was Nader's strongest state in the 2000 presidential election, giving him 10% in his presidential bid.[11] Alaska was also the third-best state for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson in the 2012 election, giving him 2.46% of the vote, behind Johnson's home state of New Mexico, and Montana.[12] For this reason, Alaska has been considered to be one of Libertarian party nominee Gary Johnson's strongest states in the 2016 election. Caucuses[edit] The two major parties chose delegates on different days.[13] Democratic caucuses[edit] Main article: 2016 Alaska Democratic caucuses 2016 Alaska Democratic caucuses ← 2012 March 1, 2016 (2016-03-01) 2020 → Candidate Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton Home state Vermont New York Delegate count 13 3 Popular vote 8,447 2,146 Percentage 79.61% 20.23% Alaska results by state house district Bernie Sanders Opinion polling[edit] See also: Statewide opinion polling for the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries § Alaska e • d 2016 Democratic Party's presidential nominating process in Alaska – Summary of results – Candidate Popular vote District delegates Estimated delegates Count Percentage Count Percentage Pledged Unpledged Total Bernie Sanders 8,447 79.61% 441 81.52% 13 1 14 Hillary Clinton 2,146 20.23% 100 18.48% 3 1 4 Rocky De La Fuente 1 <0.01% Uncommitted 16 0.15% 0 2 2 Total 10,610 100% 541 100% 16 4 20 Source: The Green Papers Republican caucus[edit] 2016 Alaska Republican caucuses ← 2012 March 1, 2016 (2016-03-01) 2020 → Candidate Ted Cruz Donald Trump Home state Texas New York Delegate count 12 11 Popular vote 8,369 7,740 Percentage 36.37% 33.64% Candidate Marco Rubio Ben Carson Home state Florida Maryland Delegate count 5 0 Popular vote 3,488 2,492 Percentage 15.16% 10.83% Alaska results by state house district Ted Cruz Donald Trump Ben Carson Alaska Republican legislative district conventions, March 1, 2016 Candidate Votes Percentage Actual delegate count Bound Unbound Total Ted Cruz 8,369 36.37% 12 0 12 Donald Trump 7,740 33.64% 11 0 11 Marco Rubio 3,488 15.16% 5 0 5 Ben Carson 2,492 10.83% 0 0 0 John Kasich 918 3.99% 0 0 0 Unprojected delegates: 0 0 0 Total: 23,010 100.00% 28 0 28 Source: The Green Papers and Alaska Republican Party Controversy[edit] At the Republican National Convention, Alaska's floor votes were all recorded for Donald Trump by the convention secretary, even though the Alaska delegation read their votes according to the results of the caucuses- 12 for Cruz, 11 for Trump and 5 for Rubio. An Alaska delegate challenged the results as recorded.[14] However, RNC chair Reince Priebus defended the actions of the convention secretary, saying that the delegates were bound to Trump.[15] General election[edit] Predictions[edit] The following are final 2016 predictions from various organizations for Alaska as of Election Day.
