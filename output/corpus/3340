Read More ▼ Larry Hogan’s stunning upset over Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown, a Democrat, was the icing on the cake for the Republican Governors Association as most Republican incumbents in other states fended off strong challengers. Though the race was close, with the Democratic Governors Association making a hefty investment to try to protect the seat, Mr. Brown had been expected to win in the state President Obama carried with 62 percent of the vote in 2012. Democrats may have underestimated the impact of Mr. Brown’s involvement in the state’s botched health insurance exchange, which Gov. Martin O’Malley appointed him to manage. Mr. Hogan is the founder and chief executive of a cluster of real estate companies and a former state cabinet secretary. • Transportation trust fund gets new protection. Read More ▼ The state’s Transportation Trust Fund will be off limits for nontransportation purposes, as Maryland residents on Tuesday voted to shield the money for expenses like highway maintenance from being picked over to cushion budget shortfalls. Any other use of the money will require an executive order from the governor declaring a fiscal emergency, as well as the approval of a three-fifths majority of each of the state’s legislative chambers. • Democratic state senator wins bid for attorney general. Read More ▼ Brian E. Frosh, a Democratic state senator, will be the state’s next top legal official. His party has held the office since 1954. Having emerged from a rough primary, he predictably defeated Jeffrey Pritzker, a Republican, replacing Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, who mounted an ultimately unsuccessful bid for governor instead of running for re-election. —EMMARIE HUETTEMAN Governor National Map » Larry Hogan has been called the winner of the race.
