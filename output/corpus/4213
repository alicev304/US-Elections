List of governors of Texas From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Wikipedia list article Governor of Texas Gubernatorial seal Gubernatorial standard Incumbent Greg Abbott since January 20, 2015 Style Governor (informal) The Honorable (formal) Residence Texas Governor's Mansion Term length Four years, no term limit Inaugural holder James Pinckney Henderson 1846 Formation Texas Constitution Salary $150,000 (2013)[1] Website Official website The governor of Texas is the chief executive of the U.S. State of Texas, the presiding officer over the executive branch of the Government of Texas, and the commander-in-chief of the Texas National Guard, the state's militia. The governor has the power to consider bills passed by the Texas Legislature, by signing them into law, or vetoing them, and in bills relating to appropriations, the power of a line-item veto. He may convene the legislature, and grant pardons and reprieves,[2] except in cases of impeachment, and upon the permission of the legislature, in cases of treason. The State provides an official residence, the Governor's Mansion in Austin. The incumbent, Greg Abbott, is the forty-eighth governor to serve in the office since Texas' statehood in 1845. When compared to those of other states, the governorship of Texas has been described as one of relative weakness.[3][4] In some respects, it is the lieutenant governor of Texas, who presides over the Texas Senate, who possesses greater influence to exercise their prerogatives.[3][4] The governor is inaugurated on the third Tuesday of January every four years along with the lieutenant governor, and serves a term of four years. Prior to the present laws, in 1845, the state's first constitution established the office of governor, serving a term of two years, but no more than four years of every six.[5] The 1861 constitution, following secession from the Union, established the first Monday of November following election as the term's start.[6] Following the end of the American Civil War, the 1866 constitution increased term length to four years, limiting overall service to no more than eight years of every twelve, moving the term's start to the first Thursday following organization of the legislature, or "as soon thereafter as practicable."[7] The constitution of 1869, enacted during Reconstruction, removed term limitations,[8] to this day making Texas one of fourteen states[9] with no limit on gubernatorial terms. The present constitution of 1876 returned terms to two years,[10] but a 1972 amendment again returned them to four.[11] Since its establishment, only one man has served in excess of eight years as governor: Rick Perry. Perry, the longest-serving governor in state history, assumed the governorship in 2000 upon the exit of George W. Bush, who resigned to take office as the 43rd president of the United States. Perry was re-elected in 2002, 2006, and 2010 serving for 14 years before choosing to retire in 2014. Allan Shivers assumed the governorship upon the death of Beauford Jester in July 1949 and was re-elected in 1950, 1952 and 1954, serving for 7 1/2 years, making him the second longest serving Texas governor. Price Daniel was elected to the governorship in 1956 and re-elected in 1958 and 1960 before losing his re-election for an unprecedented fourth term in the 1962 Democratic primary, missing the runoff. John Connally was elected in 1962 and re-elected in 1964 and 1966 before leaving office on January 21, 1969. In the case of a vacancy in the office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor.[12] Prior to a 1999 amendment, the lieutenant governor only acted as governor until the expiration of the term to which he succeeded.[13][14] Contents 1 Governors of Spanish Texas 2 Governors of Mexican Texas 3 Governors of Texas 4 Succession 5 Other high offices held 6 Living former governors of Texas 7 Gubernatorial trivia 7.1 Background 7.2 Elections 7.3 Texas governors in popular culture 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Governors of Spanish Texas[edit] See: List of Texas Governors and Presidents Governors of Mexican Texas[edit] See: List of Texas Governors and Presidents Governors of Texas[edit] Number of governors of Texas by party affiliation Party Governors Democratic 39 Republican 7 Unionist 1 Independent 1 Military 1 # Governor Term in office Party Election Prior office Lt.

The most recent death of a former governor was that of Mark White (served 1983–1987), who died on August 5, 2017. The most recently serving governor of Texas who has died is Ann Richards (served 1991–1995, born 1933), who died on September 13, 2006. Pictured in order of service: George W. Bush (1995–2000) (1946-07-06) July 6, 1946 (age 73) Rick Perry (2000–2015) (1950-03-04) March 4, 1950 (age 70) Gubernatorial trivia[edit] Along with the Seal of Office, the governor of Texas also has a flag. It is not in common use. Background[edit] Texas has had two female governors: Miriam A. "Ma" Ferguson and Ann Richards. Ferguson was one of the first two women elected governor of a U.S. state (on November 4, 1924), along with Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming. Ross was inaugurated on January 5, 1925, while Ferguson was inaugurated on January 20, so Ross is considered the first female state governor. Ferguson was the wife of former governor Jim "Pa" Ferguson, while Richards was elected "in her own right," being neither the spouse nor widow of a governor. Texas governors have been born in fourteen states: Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Baylor University is the most common alma mater of Texas governors, with five of them - Lawrence Sullivan Ross, Pat Morris Neff, Price Daniel, Mark White, and Ann Richards - considered alumni (though Ross attended but never completed a degree). To date, Coke Stevenson is the most recent governor who never attended college, and Bill Clements is the most recent who attended college but did not graduate. Elections[edit] Three governors have served non-consecutive terms: Elisha M. Pease, Miriam A. Ferguson, and Bill Clements. As was the case in most Southern states, Texas did not elect any Republican governor from the end of Reconstruction until the late twentieth century. Bill Clements was the state's first Republican governor since Edmund J. Davis left office in 1874, 105 years earlier. Dolph Briscoe was the last governor to be elected to a two-year term, in 1972; he was also the first to be elected to a four-year term, in 1974, since the post-Reconstruction period when two-year terms had first been established. Rick Perry, who ascended to the governorship on December 21, 2000 upon the resignation of then-Governor George W. Bush, won full four-year terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010. Texas governors in popular culture[edit] W. Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel served as the inspiration for the fictional, but similarly named, Mississippi governor Menelaus "Pappy" O'Daniel, in the film O Brother, Where Art Thou? Ann Richards had a cameo appearance on an episode of the animated comedy series King of the Hill, in which she has a brief romance with Bill Dauterive after he takes the fall for mooning her in the elevator of an Austin hotel (Hank actually mooned her because he thought his friends were going to be mooning the people in the elevator but they set him up).
