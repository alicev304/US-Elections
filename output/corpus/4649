Television broadcasting was suspended, however, during World War II. Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial owned-and-operated television station (WJZ-TV, now WABC-TV) and production center in New York City in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on CBS and NBC. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer affiliate stations, as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s. Under Roone Arledge[edit] Only after Roone Arledge, the president of ABC Sports at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast "model", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including 20/20, World News Tonight, This Week, Nightline and Primetime Live.[3] ABC News' longtime slogan, "More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen to and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.[4] In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), Nine Network and ITN sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the Associated Press. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service Associated Press Television News (APTV) while providing material from ABC's news video service ABC News One to APTV.[5] Modern era[edit] On August 7, 2014, ABC announced that it would relaunch its radio network division, ABC Radio, on January 1, 2015: the change occurred following the announcement that Cumulus would replace its ABC News radio service with Westwood One News (via CNN).[6] On September 20, 2019, ABC Radio was renamed as ABC Audio as the network has evolved to offer a podcast portfolio and other forms of on-demand and linear content.[7] On September 10, 2018, ABC News launched a second attempt to extend its Good Morning America brand into the afternoon with Strahan, Sara and Keke.[8] ABC News: Live steaming channel was launched on Roku in May 2019.[9] Programming[edit] Current ABC News programs[edit] 20/20 (June 6, 1978 – present) ABC World News Tonight (July 10, 1978 – present) America This Morning (July 5, 1982 – present) GMA3: Strahan, Sara & Keke (September 10, 2018 – present)[8] Good Morning America (November 3, 1975 – present) Good Morning America Weekend (January 3, 1993 – present) Nightline (March 24, 1980 – present) This Week (November 15, 1981 – present) What Would You Do?

Other services[edit] ABC News Radio[edit] Main article: ABC News Radio ABC News Radio is the radio service of ABC Audio, a division of the ABC News. Formerly known as ABC Radio News, ABC News Radio feeds through Skyview Networks with newscasts on the hour to its affiliates. ABC News Radio is the largest commercial radio news organization in the US. ABCNews.com[edit] ABCNews.com launched on May 15, 1997 by ABC News Internet Ventures, a joint venture between Starwave Corporation and ABC formed in April 1997.[11][12] Starwave had owned and operated ESPNet SportsZone (later known as ESPN.com) since 1995, which licensed the ESPN brand and video clips from ABC's corporate sister ESPN Inc. Disney wanted more control of their Internet properties, which meant ABCNews.com was operated as a joint venture with ABC News having editorial control.[13] Disney had also bought a minority stake in Starwave before the launch of ABCNews.com and would later buy the company outright.[14] The website initially had a dedicated staff of about 30.[15] In addition to articles, it featured short video clips and audio from the start, delivered using RealAudio and RealVideo technology.[16] Some content was also available via America Online. In 2011, ABC News and Yahoo News announced a strategic partnership to share ABC's online reporting on Yahoo's website; the deal expanded in 2015 to include the Disney/ABC Television Group.[17] FiveThirtyEight[edit] Main article: FiveThirtyEight FiveThirtyEight, sometimes referred to as 538, is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. The website, which takes its name from the number of electors in the United States electoral college,[18] was founded on March 7, 2008, as a polling aggregation website with a blog created by analyst Nate Silver. In August 2010, the blog became a licensed feature of The New York Times online. It was renamed FiveThirtyEight: Nate Silver's Political Calculus. In July 2013, ESPN announced that it would become the owner of the FiveThirtyEight brand and site, and Silver was appointed as editor-in-chief.[19] The ESPN-owned FiveThirtyEight began publication on March 17, 2014. In April 2018, ABC News acquired the site from ESPN.[20] In the ESPN/ABC News era, the FiveThirtyEight blog has covered a broad spectrum of subjects including politics, sports, science, economics, and popular culture. ABC News Live[edit] ABC News Live is a 24/7 streaming video news channel for breaking news, live events, newscasts and longer-form reports and documentaries[21] operated by ABC News since 2018,[22] available through Roku, Hulu, Sling TV, Xumo and the news division's other streaming platforms.[23] The service is under the direction of Colby Smith, senior vice president and general manager of ABC News Digital and Live Streaming and Justin Dial as senior executive producer of ABC News Live.[21] With news channels getting high ratings from the 2016 election and ABC News having exited its joint venture news channel, ABC began looking at launching a new 24-hour digital news channel.[24] ABC News Live launched exclusive on Roku in March 2018[9] then added to Facebook Watch and ABC apps and websites. Also on October 26, 2018, the channel was added to Hulu With Live TV[25] followed by Hulu streaming on March 20, 2020.[23] On January 23, 2020, ABC News announced an expansion of staffing for the streaming channel and changes in programming to add newscasts and long form reports and documentaries being roll out over a month's time. Formerly working on Vice News' HBO daily program, Justin Dial was hired as senior executive producer of ABC News Live. Tom Llamas would anchor breaking news coverage at the time of the Iowa caucuses, while Linsey Davis would anchor two weekday one-hour evening newscasts.[21] ABC News planned as of March 2020 that ABC News Live would air 18 hours of programming daily.[23] This unit is producing: ABC News Live Prime, two weekday one-hour evening newscasts (February 2020-)[21] Pandemic: What You Need to Know which for the time being (since March 18, 2020) has replaced Strahan, Sara and Keke on ABC network. The show covering the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic and is anchored by Amy Robach assisted by Jennifer Ashton, ABC News’ chief medical correspondent.[26] Previously produced: “Around the Table an irregular (September 10, 2019 -?) Presidential candidate interview program in which Democratic candidates are interviewed by three voters and moderated by anchors and correspondents around a table. Episodes would be used as a part of that night's Nightline. In the first episode, Byron Pitts moderates Beto O’Rourke with the second episode being Linsey Davis moderating Senator Cory Booker.[27] Guardians of the Amazon (February 2020) Nightline team produced documentary regarding rain forest destruction[21] Former[edit] Satellite News Channel[edit] Main article: Satellite News Channel Satellite News Channel was a joint venture between ABC News and Group W that started on June 21, 1982, as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and seven Washington, D.C.-based crews, in addition to stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, CNN (a subsidiary of Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting System). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel's operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or CNN2 on most cable systems. Group W eventually shut down seven years later, in 1999. Following Satellite News Channel's discontinuation, ABC News did not return to the 24-hour cable news world until 22 years later, in 2004, when they launched ABC News Now, whose launch indicated that Satellite News Channel was ABC News' first attempt in the 24-hour cable news world. ABC News Now[edit] Main article: ABC News Now ABC News Now was a 24-hour cable news network that was launched on July 26, 2004 as a digital subchannel by ABC News, being the company's second attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after Satellite News Channel. It was offered via digital television, broadband and streaming video at ABCNews.com[28] and on mobile phones. It delivered breaking news, headline news each half hour, and wide range of entertainment and lifestyle programming. The channel was available in the United States and Europe. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel when after its experimental phase had ended with the President inauguration in 2005. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with Fusion on October 28, 2013. Fusion[edit] Main article: Fusion TV Fusion is a digital cable and satellite network that is owned & operated by Fusion Media Group, LLC, which was a joint venture between ABC News and Univision Communications. ABC and Univision formally announced its launch on May 2, 2012. Launched on October 28, 2013, Fusion features a mix of traditional news and investigative programs along with satirical content aimed at English-speaking Hispanic and Latino American adults between the ages of 18 and 34.[29][30] Fusion was ABC News' third attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after Satellite News Channel in 1982 and ABC News Now (which it replaced) in 2004. In December 2015, it was reported that Disney was in talks to sell its stake in Fusion to Univision.[31] The split was complete on April 21, 2016.[32] Personnel[edit] Correspondents and reporters[edit] Dan Abrams – chief legal analyst (2011–present) Dr. Jennifer Ashton – chief health and medical editor; chief medical correspondent (2012–present) Jim Avila – senior national correspondent (2000–present) Adrienne Bankert – correspondent Gio Benitez – transportation correspondent; anchor, Nightline on Fusion (2013–present) Deirdre Bolton - business correspondent Abbie Boudreau – Good Morning America and Nightline correspondent (2010–present) Howard Bragman – contributor (2010–present) Kimberly Brooks - correspondent Mary Bruce - senior congressional correspondent Will Carr - correspondent Juju Chang – co-anchor, Nightline (1996–present) Chris Christie – contributor[33] (2018–present) Chris Connelly – contributor, Good Morning America and 20/20 (2001–present) Linsey Davis - anchor, ABC News Live Prime; correspondent (2007–present) John Donvan – Washington correspondent (1982-1985; 1988–present) Matthew Dowd – chief political analyst; special correspondent (2007–present) Devin Dwyer - senior Washington reporter (2007–present) Paula Faris – senior national correspondent (2012–present) Marci Gonzalez – correspondent (2013–present) Matt Gutman – chief national correspondent (2008–present) Sara Haines – co-host, GMA3: Strahan, Sara & Keke; correspondent (2013–present) Dan Harris – co-anchor, Good Morning America Weekend; correspondent; host, 10% Happier (2000–present) Lama Hasan – London correspondent (2003–present) T.

In Australia, Sky News Australia airs daily broadcasts of World News Tonight (at 10:30 a.m.) and Nightline (at 1:30 a.m.) as well as weekly airings of 20/20 (on Wednesdays at 1:30 p.m., with an extended version at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally Primetime (at 1:30 p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00 p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country's public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, operates its own unrelated news division that is also named ABC News. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content sharing agreement with the Nine Network, which also broadcasts GMA domestically in the early morning before its own breakfast program. In New Zealand, ABC World News was broadcast daily at 5:10 p.m. and at again at 11:35 p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., TVNZ 7 (owned by Television New Zealand) aired the program commercial-free, until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.
