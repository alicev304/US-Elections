Primary endorsements are separately listed - see Newspaper endorsements in the United States presidential primaries, 2016. Media journalist Jim Rutenberg wrote in early October 2016 that endorsements in the 2016 presidential election were distinguished by "blunt condemnation" of the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and by a "save the Republic" tone.[1] Trump received endorsements from only 20 daily newspapers and six weekly newspapers nationwide, of which only two, the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the (Jacksonville) Florida Times-Union, had circulations of above 100,000.[2] The small number of endorsements received by Trump was unprecedented in American history for a candidate from a major party.[3][4][5] Among the United States' 100 largest newspapers by paid circulation, 57 endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton,[6] while only two, the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the Florida Times-Union, endorsed Trump. Four (the Chicago Tribune, the Detroit News, the Richmond Times-Dispatch, and the Charleston (South Carolina) Post and Courier) endorsed Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson,[7] while three other newspapers (USA Today, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel) specifically discouraged their readers from voting for Trump. Clinton won support from not only traditionally Democratic-leaning newspapers, but also traditionally non-political and conservative newspapers,[1][2] including those that had "...either never before supported a Democrat or had not in many decades ... or had never endorsed any presidential candidate, like USA Today."[1] Many newspapers that endorsed Clinton encouraged readers to vote for her primarily, if not solely, to prevent Trump from being elected president. That a handful of newspapers endorsed third party candidates, including independent candidate Evan McMullin as well as Johnson, broke from the usual practice of newspaper editorial boards endorsing only a candidate from one of the two major parties.[2][8] Summary of newspaper and magazine endorsements in the 2016 United States presidential election Candidate Daily Weekly Magazines College International Total Hillary Clinton 243 148 15 77 17 500 No endorsement 64 13 0 5 0 82 Not Donald Trump 8 2 4 12 4 30 Donald Trump 20 6 0 0 2 28 Gary Johnson 9 0 0 0 0 9 Split endorsement 2 0 0 0 0 2 Evan McMullin 1 0 0 0 0 1 Not Hillary Clinton 1 0 0 0 0 1 Contents 1 Daily newspapers 1.1 Summary of daily newspapers 1.2 Endorsements by daily newspapers 2 Weekly newspapers 2.1 Summary of weekly newspapers 2.2 Endorsements by weekly newspapers 3 Magazines 3.1 Summary of magazines 3.2 Endorsements by magazines 4 College and university newspapers 4.1 Summary of student newspapers 4.2 Endorsements by student newspapers 5 Foreign newspapers and magazines 5.1 Summary of foreign periodicals 5.2 Endorsements by foreign periodicals 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Daily newspapers[edit] Summary of daily newspapers[edit] Candidate Endorsements Breakdown by 2012 endorsement Hillary Clinton 243 99 Barack Obama; 47 Mitt Romney; 19 no endorsement; 1 split endorsement; 76 undetermined No endorsement 64 38 Mitt Romney; 2 Barack Obama; 2 no endorsement; 11 undetermined Donald Trump 20 14 Mitt Romney; 6 undetermined Gary Johnson 9 2 Barack Obama; 5 Mitt Romney; 2 undetermined Not Donald Trump 8 2 Mitt Romney; 1 Barack Obama; 4 no endorsement; 1 undetermined Split endorsement 2 2 split endorsement Evan McMullin 1 1 undetermined Not Hillary Clinton 1 1 undetermined Endorsements by daily newspapers[edit] Main article: Daily newspaper endorsements in the 2016 United States presidential election Weekly newspapers[edit] This list includes newspapers that publish three or fewer times per week.
