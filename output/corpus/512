President before election Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican Elected President Thomas Jefferson Democratic-Republican The 1804 United States presidential election was the fifth quadrennial presidential election, held from Friday, November 2, to Wednesday, December 5, 1804. Incumbent Democratic-Republican President Thomas Jefferson defeated Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina. It was the first presidential election conducted following the ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reformed procedures for electing presidents and vice presidents. Jefferson was re-nominated by his party's congressional nominating caucus without opposition, and the party nominated Governor George Clinton of New York to replace Aaron Burr as Jefferson's running mate. With former President John Adams in retirement, the Federalists turned to Pinckney, a former ambassador and Revolutionary War hero who had been Adams's running mate in the 1800 election. Though Jefferson had only narrowly defeated Adams in 1800, he was widely popular due to the Louisiana Purchase and a strong economy. He carried almost every state, including most states in the Federalist stronghold of New England. Several states did not hold a popular vote for president, but Jefferson dominated the popular vote in the states that did. Jefferson's 45.6 percentage point victory margin in the popular vote remains the highest victory margin in a presidential election in which there were multiple major party candidates.

American trade boomed due to the temporary suspension of hostilities during the French Revolutionary Wars in Europe, and the Louisiana Purchase was heralded as a great achievement. Nominations[edit] Democratic-Republican Party nomination[edit] Democratic-Republican Party Ticket, 1804 Thomas Jefferson George Clinton for President for Vice President 3rd President of the United States (1801–1809) 1st Governor of New York (1777–1795 & 1801–1804) Campaign The February 1804 Democratic-Republican congressional nominating caucus selected the ticket. Unlike the previous election, the nominating caucus did not meet in secret. Jefferson's re-nomination was never in any real doubt, with the real issue being seen as who the party would nominate to replace Vice President Aaron Burr, whose relationship with Jefferson had soured. Governor George Clinton of New York was chosen as Jefferson's running mate, continuing the party's tradition of nominating a ticket consisting of a Virginian and a New Yorker.[2] Vice-presidential candidates[edit] John Breckinridge (Kentucky), U.S. Senator George Clinton (New York), Governor Gideon Granger (Connecticut), Postmaster General John Langdon (New Hampshire), former U.S. Senator Levi Lincoln (Massachusetts), U.S. Attorney General William Maclay (Pennsylvania), former U.S. Senator Senator John Breckinridge from Kentucky Governor George Clinton of New York Postmaster General Gideon Granger from Connecticut Former Senator John Langdon from New Hampshire Attorney General Levi Lincoln from Massachusetts Former Senator William Maclay from Pennsylvania Balloting[edit] Presidential ballot Total Vice-presidential ballot Total Thomas Jefferson 108 George Clinton 67 John Breckinridge 20 Levi Lincoln 9 John Langdon 7 Gideon Granger 4 William Maclay 1 Federalist Party nomination[edit] Federalist Party Ticket, 1804 Charles C. Pinckney Rufus King for President for Vice President Former U.S. Minister to France (1796–1797) Former U.S. Minister to Great Britain (1796–1803) Campaign The Federalists did not hold a nominating caucus, but Federalist Congressional leaders informally agreed to nominate a ticket consisting of Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina and former Senator Rufus King of New York.[2] Pinckney's public service during and after the American Revolutionary War had won him national stature, and Federalists hoped that Pinckney would win some Southern votes away from Jefferson, who had dominated the Southern vote in the previous election.[3] General election[edit] Federalist leader Alexander Hamilton's death in July 1804 following the Burr–Hamilton duel destroyed whatever hope the Federalists had of defeating the popular Jefferson. Leaderless and disorganized, the Federalists failed to attract much support outside of New England. The Federalists attacked the Louisiana Purchase as unconstitutional, criticized Jefferson's gunboat navy, and alleged that Jefferson had fathered children with his slave, Sally Hemings, but the party failed to galvanize opposition to Jefferson. Jefferson's policies of expansionism and reduced government spending were widely popular. Jefferson was aided by an effective Democratic-Republican party organization, which had continued to develop since 1800, especially in the Federalist stronghold of New England.[2] Jefferson's victory was overwhelming, and he even won four of the five New England states. Pinckney won only two states, Connecticut and Delaware. This was the first election where the Democratic-Republicans won in Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. This was the last time that Massachusetts voted for the Democratic-Republicans until 1820, and the last time that New Hampshire and Rhode Island voted for the Democratic-Republicans until 1816.
