{{see|Elections in the United States|Voting rights in the United States|Voter registration in the United States}}

The U.S. presidential election process, like all other [[elections in the United States]], is a highly decentralized system.<ref name="NCSL">{{cite web|title=Election Administration at State and Local Levels|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/election-administration-at-state-and-local-levels.aspx|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> While the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] does set parameters for the election of the president and other federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including the primaries, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), and the specific details of running each state's electoral college meeting. All elections, including federal, are administered by the individual states.<ref name="whitehouse">{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/elections-and-voting |title=Elections & Voting |website=Whitehouse.gov |accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref>

Thus, the presidential election is really an amalgamation of separate state elections instead of a single national election run by the federal government. Candidates must submit separate filings in each of the 50 states if they want to qualify on each state's ballot, and the requirements for filing vary by state.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/time-running-short-for-new-2020-democrats-to-jump-in-as-filing-deadlines-approach|title=Time running short for new 2020 Democrats to jump in as filing deadlines approach |newspaper=Washington Examiner |date=October 25, 2019}}</ref>

The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the Constitution and regulated at state level. The [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]], [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th]] and [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th]] Amendments to the Constitution state that [[suffrage]] cannot be denied on grounds of race or color, sex, or age for citizens eighteen years or older, respectively. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility and registration.<ref name="whitehouse"/> And the specific requirements for voter eligibility and registration also vary by state, e.g. some states ban convicted felons from voting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/18/should-convicted-felons-be-allowed-to-vote-after-theyve-served-their-time/|title=Should Felons Be Allowed to Vote After They Have Served Their Time?|first=Michael|last=Gonchar|website=Learning.blogs.nytimes.com|accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>
