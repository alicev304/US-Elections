Trump signed Executive Order (EO) 13807 titled “Establishing Discipline and Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for Infrastructure,” which was published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2017. 82 FR 40463. The Executive Order seeks to reduce the unnecessary burdens and uncertainties of the Federal regulatory process that can delay major infrastructure projects and hold back the American economy. On September 14, 2017, CEQ published a notice in the Federal Register announcing an initial list of actions to enhance and modernize the Federal environmental review and authorization process for infrastructure projects. To comply with Section 5(d) of EO 13807, CEQ will refer various requests for designation of State projects pursuant to EO 13766 to the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, Department of Transportation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as appropriate. CEQ will, as appropriate in response to any additional requests from States, refer projects that qualify for designation as high priority projects in accordance with Section 5(d) of EO 13807. The Federal Infrastructure Permitting Dashboard tracks the Federal government’s environmental review and authorization processes for covered major infrastructure projects. To comply with Section 5(b) EO 13807, on March 20, 2018, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and CEQ signed a Memorandum titled “One Federal Decision Framework for the Environmental Review and Authorization Process for Major Infrastructure Projects under Executive Order 13807.” Pursuant to that Memorandum, federal agencies signed a One Federal Decision Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which was announced on April 9, 2018. Signatories to the MOU include the Departments of the Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, and Homeland Security, Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, and Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council. To comply with Section 5(e) of EO 13807, including a review of existing CEQ regulations and guidance, on June 20, 2018, CEQ issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled “Update to the Regulations for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act,” seeking comment on potential revisions to update and clarify CEQ’s NEPA regulations. On June 21, 2019, CEQ also issued “Draft [NEPA] Guidance on Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions,” and has requested public comment. To comply with Section 5(b)(iv)(C) of EO 13807, on February 26, 2019, OMB and CEQ issued guidance for states with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) assignment responsibilities under the Surface Transportation Program.
