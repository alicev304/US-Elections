Democratic National Committee From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Democratic National Committee Founded 1848; 172 years ago (1848)[1][2] Headquarters 430 South Capitol St SE, Washington, D.C. 20003 , U.S. Key people Tom Perez (Chairman) Chris Korge (Finance chair) Michael Tyler (Spokesperson) Website democrats.org The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is a corporation acting as the governing body for the United States Democratic Party. The committee coordinates strategy to support Democratic Party candidates throughout the country for local, state, and national office. It organizes the Democratic National Convention held every four years to nominate and confirm a candidate for President of the United States, and to formulate the party platform. While it provides support for party candidates, it does not have direct authority over elected officials.[3] Its chair is elected by the committee. It conducts fundraising to support its activities.[3] The DNC was established at the 1848 Democratic National Convention.[1] The DNC's main counterpart is the Republican National Committee.

When the president is a Democrat, the party generally works closely with the president. In presidential elections, it supervises the national convention and, both independently and in coordination with the presidential candidate, raises funds, commissions polls, and coordinates campaign strategy. Following the selection of a party nominee, the public funding laws permit the national party to coordinate certain expenditures with the nominee, but additional funds are spent on general, party-building activities.[4] There are state committees in every state, as well as local committees in most cities, wards, and towns (and, in most states, counties). The chairperson of the DNC is elected by vote of members of the Democratic National Committee.[5]:5 The DNC is composed of the chairs and vice-chairs of each state Democratic Party's central committee, two hundred members apportioned among the states based on population and generally elected either on the ballot by primary voters or by the state Democratic Party committee, a number of elected officials serving in an ex officio capacity, and a variety of representatives of major Democratic Party constituencies. Chicago delegation to the January 8, 1912 Democratic National Committee The DNC establishes rules for the caucuses and primaries which choose delegates to the Democratic National Convention, but the caucuses and primaries themselves are most often run not by the DNC but instead by each individual state. Primary elections, in particular, are invariably conducted by state governments according to their own laws. Political parties may choose to participate or not participate in a state's primary election, but no political party executives have any jurisdiction over the dates of primary elections, or how they are conducted.[citation needed] Outside of the process of nominating a presidential candidate, the DNC's role in actually selecting candidates to run on the party ticket is minimal.[citation needed] All DNC members are superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention, whose role can take precedence over a close primary race. However, the methodology for this has been called into dispute in both the 2016 and 2020 primary races and concerns the question of candidates achieving a voter majority vs plurality. By virtue of remaining on the ballot, candidates may then likely impede party voters to realize a majority for any single candidate. This is how superdelegates currently function. These delegates, officially described as "unpledged party leader and elected official delegates," fall into three categories based on other positions they hold:[6] elected members of the Democratic National Committee, sitting Democratic governors and members of Congress, and distinguished party leaders, consisting of current and former presidents, vice presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs, are all superdelegates for life. DNC fundraising[edit] In the 2002 election cycle, the DNC and its affiliated committees (which include numerous local committees and committees formed to coordinate expenditures for specific districts or races) raised a total of US$162,062,084, 42% of which was hard money. The largest contributor, with US$7,297,937 was the Saban Capital Group, founded in 2001 by Haim Saban. Fred Eychaner, the owner of Newsweb Corporation, gave the second highest amount of money to the DNC and its affiliates, US$5,175,000. The third largest contributor was Steve Bing of Shangri-La Entertainment, who gave US$4,758,000.[7] In the 2006 election cycle, the DNC raised a total of US$37,939,887. The three largest contributors were investment bank Goldman Sachs (US$225,600). University of California (US$121,980) and Pond North LLP (US$109,296).[8] The DNC introduced a small-donor fund raising campaign, the Democracy Bonds program, set up by Howard Dean in the summer of 2005.[9] There were only 31,000 Democracy Bond donors by May 2006, off-pace from the goal of 1 million donors by 2008. The program no is longer in place. In the 2016 election cycle, the DNC raised a total of US$75,945,536 as of July 21, 2016. The three largest contributors were hedge fund Renaissance Technologies (US$677,850), Newsweb Corp (US$334,000) and Total Wine (US$298,100).[10] In June 2008, after Senator Barack Obama became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Dean announced that the DNC, emulating the Obama campaign, would no longer accept donations from federal lobbyists.[11] In July 2015, during the 2016 election cycle, the DNC, led by Debbie Wasserman Schultz, reversed this policy.[12] Current leadership[edit] Chair: Tom Perez, former U.S. Secretary of Labor under Barack Obama[13] Vice Chair of Civic Engagement and Voter Participation: Karen Carter Peterson[14] Vice Chairs: Michael Blake, New York Assemblyman[14] Jaime Harrison, Associate Chair and former South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman[14] Maria Elena Durazo, Executive Secretary–Treasurer of the AFL-CIO[15] Ken Martin, Chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party[16] Grace Meng, U.S. Representative from New York's 6th congressional district[17] Treasurer: William "Bill" Derrough[18] Secretary: Jason Rae[19] Finance Chair: Chris Korge II[15] In addition, a National Advisory Board exists for purposes of fundraising and advising the executive.

After a close victory over Minnesota Congressman Keith Ellison, Perez appointed Ellison as Deputy Chair in an attempt to lessen the divide in the Democratic Party after the contentious 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, which saw conflicts between supporters of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.[21] Perez was seen as being more in line with the Clinton wing, while Ellison was more in line with the Sanders wing.[22] The role's revival in 2017 has been described by critics as largely titular and ceremonial.[23] On November 8, 2018, Ellison resigned from the position due to his win in the Minnesota Attorney General election.[24] The position remains unoccupied. Officeholder Term State Ben Johnson[25] 2003–2005 Maryland Mike Honda 2003–2005 California Susan Turnbull 2003–2005 Maryland Keith Ellison 2017–2018[26] Minnesota Controversies[edit] Opposition to 2020 primary debate on climate change[edit] In June 2019, DNC Chair Tom Perez responded to calls for the DNC to hold a presidential candidate debate devoted to climate change policy. In a statement published to his Medium page, he confirmed that there would be no such climate debate in the 2020 primary season as the debate guidelines had already been set and could not be adjusted mid-race without sacrificing fairness to the candidates.[27] Nevertheless, in January 2020 the DNC would go on to make immense adjustments to its debate guidelines by easing the grassroots donor requirement necessary to appear on the Nevada debate stage. Several candidates and their campaigns expressed concern that the new guidelines displayed overt favoritism by the DNC, as the changes were enacted to the sole benefit of Michael Bloomberg’s upstart candidacy and had not been adopted earlier in the race when other candidates such as Cory Booker had requested similar measures. Bloomberg had consistently failed to qualify for the debate stage under the previous guidelines.[28] In another departure from Perez’s June statement, as of August 2019, the DNC is no longer attempting to limit the candidates' participation in events such as a CNN town hall or an MSNBC forum on the topic.[29] Watergate incident[edit] Main article: Watergate scandal In the 1970s, the DNC had its head office in the Watergate complex, which were burglarized by entities working for Richard Nixon's administration during the Watergate scandal. Chinagate[edit] Main article: 1996 United States campaign finance controversy The Chinagate was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China to influence domestic American politics prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fund-raising practices of the administration itself.[30][31] In 2002, the Federal Election Commission fined the Democratic National Committee $115,000 for its part in fundraising violations in 1996.[32] DNC hacking[edit] Main article: Democratic National Committee cyber attacks Debbie Wasserman Schultz served as DNC chair from 2011 to 2016. Cyber attacks and hacks were claimed by or attributed to various individual and groups such as: According to committee officials and security experts, two competing Russian intelligence services were discovered on DNC computer networks sometime in May 2016. One intelligence service achieved infiltration beginning in the summer of 2015 and the other service breached and roamed the network beginning in April 2016. The two groups accessed emails, chats, and research on an opposing presidential candidate. They were expelled from the DNC system in June 2016.[33][34][35] The hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed that he hacked into the Democratic National Committee computer network and then leaked its emails to both the newspaper The Hill[36][37] and the whistleblowing website WikiLeaks.[citation needed] During a CNN interview with Jake Tapper, Hillary Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, cited experts saying that the DNC emails were leaked by the Russians. When pressed to name the "experts," Mook declined to.[38][39] The press and cybersecurity firms discredited the Guccifer 2.0 claim, as investigators now believe Guccifer 2.0 was an agent of the G.R.U., Russia's military intelligence service."[33][35][40][41] Coordination with 2016 Clinton primary campaign[edit] Main article: 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak See also: Wilding v. DNC Services Corp. On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks released approximately 20,000 DNC emails.[42] Critics claimed that the Committee unequally favored Hillary Clinton and acted in support of her nomination while opposing the candidacy of her primary challenger Bernie Sanders. Donna Brazile corroborated these allegations in an excerpt of her book published by Politico in November 2017, and also claimed that the Clinton campaign bought control of the DNC.[43] The leaked emails spanned sixteen months, terminating in May 2016.[44] The hack was claimed by Guccifer 2.0, but several cybersecurity firms believe this assertion is false, instead alleging that the hacks were perpetrated by Russia, as mentioned above.[45] The WikiLeaks releases led to the resignations of Chairperson Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Communications Director Luis Miranda, Chief Financial Officer Brad Marshall and Chief Executive Amy Dacey.[46] After she resigned, Wasserman-Schultz put out a statement about possible FBI assistance in investigating the hacking and leaks, claiming "the DNC was never contacted by the FBI or any other agency concerned about these intrusions."[47] During a Senate hearing in January 2017, James Comey testified that the FBI requested access to the DNC's servers, but were denied. He also testified that old versions of the Republican National Committee's servers were breached, but then-current databases were unaffected.[48] The DNC subsequently filed a lawsuit in federal court against WikiLeaks and others alleging a conspiracy to influence the election.[49] History[edit] The Democratic Party's national committee has existed since 1848.[50] During the 1848 Democratic National Convention, a resolution was passed creating the Democratic National Committee, composed of thirty members, one person per state, chosen by the states' delegations, and chaired by Benjamin F. Hallett.[51] See also[edit] Green National Committee Libertarian National Committee Republican National Committee Information published by WikiLeaks References[edit] ^ a b Party History.
