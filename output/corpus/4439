Template talk:Jill Stein series From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search This template was considered for deletion on 2019 March 21. The result of the discussion was "no consensus". Contested deletion[edit] This template should not be speedy deleted as an unambiguous misrepresentation of policy, because all four of the presidential candidates polling 5% or higher nationally should most definitely have an article series. Not to mention, there are lots of Green Party articles, including all of Stein's previous campaigns, that should all be found in one place. --Worldtraveler96 (talk) 05:55, 16 June 2016 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Jill_Stein_series&oldid=890797477" Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Template Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Download as PDF Languages This page was last edited on 3 April 2019, at 16:20 (UTC).
