The recipient of the 2019 – 2021 Model Acts grant is the Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association (LAPPA). With ONDCP funding, LAPPA conducts research and analysis on effective model laws, provides technical assistance to legislators, and drafts model legislation on current and emerging illicit drug issues. Through this initiative, state legislators nationwide have passed legislation to support greater access to naloxone, established processes by which emergency health service professionals refer overdose survivors to treatment services, increased recovery housing and other support services in colleges, and, in general, enhanced and promoted evidence-based substance use programming across the country.
