Maryland Facebook Twitter Map of Presidential Results Map of Presidential Results Map of Senate Results Map of House Results Results Size of Lead Change from ‘08 State Highlights By Ray Rivera Maryland voters backed President Obama and another incumbent Democrat, Senator Ben Cardin, in this safely blue state. In a year in which ballot initiatives stole the spotlight, Maryland voters narrowly passed a measure to legalize same-sex marriage. The measure passed with a four-point margin with 98 percent of the precincts reporting. The shift came as more black voters, who are one-third of the electorate in the state, have expressed support for same-sex marriage. Historically, blacks across the nation have been swayed on the issue by strong opposition by black religious leaders. Voters have rejected same-sex marriage in 32 states where the issue was put on the ballot. Maryland was one of four states voting on same-sex marriage this year. The others were Maine, which passed its referendum; Minnesota and Washington. As Election Day approached, voters were inundated with ads about the marriage measure and a ballot initiative that would expand gambling to raise tax dollars for schools. The gambling measure also narrowly passed. Voters also approved a measure to allow illegal immigrants to pay in-state tuition at public colleges. In House contests, John Delaney, a Democrat, beat Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Republican, for the seat Mr. Bartlett held for 20 years in the Sixth District, reshaped by the Democrat-led General Assembly last year. Mr. Delaney’s victory gives Maryland Democrats a 7-to-1 advantage in the state’s Congressional delegation. Senator Ben Cardin easily won re-election to a second term, defeating a Republican opponent, Daniel Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who is now a Web design consultant, and two other candidates.
