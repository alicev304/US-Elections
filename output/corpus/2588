This center was created in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act and Executive Order 13392, “Improving Agency Disclosure of Information,” which directs Federal agencies to ensure citizen-centered, results-oriented FOIA operations. The center provides basic instruction on obtaining CEQ information under FOIA, and the Proactive Disclosure Reading Room makes available documents on environmental issues. To save time and money, please review the material available on CEQ’s website before submitting a FOIA request How to Submit a FOIA Request Please state clearly that the request is being made under FOIA. Be as specific as you can when identifying the information you are seeking, and include your name, address, and contact information to enable us to contact you with any questions. Remember: FOIA requests and responses may be made available for public inspection, so don’t submit information involving trade secrets, confidential or proprietary commercial or financial information, or any other material you do not want to be publicly available. Submit requests electronically to efoia@ceq.eop.gov. Fax them to (202) 456-0753 or address regular mail to Freedom of Information Officer, Council on Environmental Quality, 730 Jackson Place, NW, Washington, DC 20503. For security reasons, CEQ no longer accepts or opens attachments to emails submitted to the FOIA email inbox. CEQ will not respond to FOIA requests submitted as email attachments. Please transmit attachments by fax or postal mail or include the information in the text body of the email. Note however, we may request attachments once the FOIA request has been received. CEQ FOIA Reading Room In his March 19, 2009 Memorandum on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), commonly known as the “Attorney General’s Guidelines,” Attorney General Holder instructed agencies to “readily and systematically post information online in advance of any public request.” This section of CEQ’s FOIA Requester Service Center responds to that direction, providing a wealth of information on environmental issues in general and CEQ in particular. This regularly updated site includes reports, publications, environmental laws and regulations, documents frequently requested under FOIA, the legislative history of the National Environmental Policy Act, and CEQ historical documents.

CEQ published these “reports” from 1970 through 1997; 1994 and 1995 were covered in a combined 25th anniversary report. In 1995, however, Congress passed the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act (Public Law 104-66) to eliminate a list of reports identified in House Document no. 103-7. CEQ’s Environmental Quality Report was listed on page 41. Though the Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act eliminated the requirement to submit an annual report to Congress, CEQ continues to act in accordance with the functions and duties described in section 204 of NEPA, which includes duties to gather and provide information regarding the environment. 1970 1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982 1983 1984 1985 1986 1987 – 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994-1995 1996 1997 Section 1609 (c) Reports Section 1609(c) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires that agencies report to Congress on the status and progress of NEPA reviews for Recovery Act funded projects and activities.
