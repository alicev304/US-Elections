The district, numbered as the 17th district from 2003 to 2013, takes in a large swath of northeast Ohio, from Youngstown to Akron. Ryan is a member of the Democratic Party. Born in Niles, Ohio, Ryan worked as an aide to Congressman Jim Traficant after graduating from Bowling Green State University. He served in the Ohio Senate from 2001 to 2002 before winning the election to succeed Traficant. In November 2016, Ryan launched an unsuccessful challenge to unseat Nancy Pelosi as party leader of the House Democrats. Ryan was a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. He ended his campaign on October 24, 2019 to run for re-election in Ohio's 13th congressional district.[1] Contents 1 Early life and career 2 United States Representative 2.1 Elections 2.2 Tenure 2.3 Committees and caucuses 3 2020 presidential campaign 3.1 Endorsements 4 Publications 5 Personal life 6 Electoral history 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Early life and career[edit] Ryan was born in Niles, Ohio, the son of Rochelle Maria (Rizzi) and Allen Leroy Ryan;[2] he is of Irish and Italian ancestry. Ryan's parents divorced when he was seven years old, and Ryan was raised by his mother.[3] Ryan graduated from John F. Kennedy High School in Warren, where he played football as a quarterback and coached junior high basketball. Ryan was recruited to play football at Youngstown State University, but a knee injury ended his playing career and he transferred to Bowling Green State University.[3] He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Bowling Green in 1995 and was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. After college, Ryan joined the staff of Ohio Congressman Jim Traficant.[3] In 2000, he earned a Juris Doctor degree from Franklin Pierce Law Center in Concord, New Hampshire.[4] From 2000 to 2002 he served half a term in the Ohio State Senate.[3] United States Representative[edit] Elections[edit] See also: 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio § District 13 After Jim Traficant was convicted on criminal charges in 2002, Ryan declared his candidacy for the 17th District. As the result of redistricting following the 2000 census, the 17th, which had long been based in Youngstown, had been pushed to the west and now included much of Portage County and part of Akron. Before the redistricting, all of Akron had been part of the 14th District, represented by eight-term Democrat Tom Sawyer. The 14th had been eliminated in the year 2000 redistricting; most of it was drawn into the 13th District of fellow Democrat Sherrod Brown, but Sawyer's home was drawn into the 17th. Ryan was initially seen as an underdog in a six-way Democratic primary that included Sawyer.[3] In the 2002 Democratic primary, Ryan defeated Sawyer, who was seen as insufficiently labor-friendly in the newly-drawn district. In the November 2002 general election, he faced Republican Insurance Commissioner Ann Womer Benjamin as well as Traficant, who ran as an independent from his prison cell. Ryan won with 51 percent of the vote, besting Benjamin by a solid 14-point margin. When he took office in January 2003, he was the youngest Democrat in the House, at 29 years of age. He has been reelected five times,[5][6] only once facing a contest nearly as close as his first. In 2010, he was held to 53 percent of the vote; Traficant, running as an independent, took 16 percent. In every other election since his first run for the district, Ryan has won at least 67 percent of the vote. His district was renumbered as the 13th in 2012, and was pushed westward, absorbing most of Akron. Tenure[edit] Congressman Tim Ryan talks about Making America Competitive Again and Restoring U.S. Innovation Leadership Ryan speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, October 2016 Ryan speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, October 2016 In his first year in office, Ryan was one of seven members of Congress who voted against the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, and one of 8 Congressmen who opposed ratification of FTC's establishment of a National Do Not Call Registry.[7] Ryan was a member of the "30 Something" Working Group,[8] which was a Congressional caucus that includes those members of the United States House of Representatives who are Democrats and had not yet reached the age of 40. It was organized by the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to energize and engage younger people in politics by focusing on issues that are important to them.[9] Ryan voted for the Stupak Amendment restricting federal funding for abortions, but in January 2015, he announced that having "gained a deeper understanding of the complexities and emotions that accompany the difficult decisions [about whether to end a pregnancy]" over his time in public office, he had reversed his position on abortion and now identified as pro-choice.[10] Before the 2004 presidential election, Ryan spoke on the House floor in an impassioned speech denouncing the Bush administration’s denial of a draft reinstatement, comparing this to the administration's previous claims that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction, the Bush tax cuts would create jobs, and other such claims.[11] He repeated in September 2006 with an equally heated speech accusing the Bush administration of trying to distract the public from key issues like the war in Iraq and the economy.[12] In 2010, Ryan introduced the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act, which sought punitive trade tariffs on countries, notably China, that were engaging in currency manipulation. It passed the House overwhelmingly but never made it to the floor in the Senate. In an October 2010 interview with conservative magazine Human Events, Ryan said tax increases on small businesses were necessary "because we have huge deficits. We gotta shore up Social Security. We gotta shrink our deficits".[13][14] Ryan initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House Minority Leader on November 17, 2016, prompted by colleagues following the 2016 presidential election.[15] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[16] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.[17] Ryan helped Adi Othman, an illegal immigrant in Youngstown, Ohio, remain in the United States.[18] Othman had lived in the United States for nearly 40 years, ran several businesses in Youngstown, was married to a US citizen and had four US-born children.[18] Ryan repeatedly presented a bill to Congress whereby Othman would be granted a more thorough review of his case to stay in the United States (Othman disputed a verdict by immigration officials on a matter which affected his legal status); the fact that the bill was in motion meant that Othman could temporarily stay.[18] However, in February 2018, Othman was deported from the United States after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to increase the number of arrests and deportations of illegal immigrants.[18] Ryan condemned the deportation, saying "To watch these families get ripped apart is the most heart-breaking thing any American citizen could ever see ... Because you are for these families, it doesn't mean you are not for a secure border."[18] Ryan supported the Iran nuclear deal to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. In April 2016, Ryan tweeted, "I was in Jerusalem a few weeks ago & saw firsthand the dangerous threat Israelis face. Israel has the right to defend itself from terror."[19] Committees and caucuses[edit] Committee on Appropriations[20] Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch (Chairman) Subcommittee on Defense Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Ryan is a member of the following caucuses:[21] Co-chair of the Congressional Addiction, Treatment and Recovery Caucus Co-chair of the Congressional Manufacturing Caucus United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus[22] Sportsmen's Caucus Congressional Arts Caucus[23] Ohio River Basin Congressional Caucus Afterschool Caucuses[24] 2020 presidential campaign[edit] Tim Ryan for America Campaign 2020 United States presidential election (Democratic primaries) Candidate Tim Ryan Representative from Ohio's 17th congressional district (2002-2013) and Ohio's 13th congressional district (2013-present) Affiliation Democratic Party Announced April 4, 2019 Suspended October 24, 2019 Headquarters Gaithersburg, Maryland[25] Receipts US$1,341,246.39[26] (12/31/2019) Slogan Our Future Is Now Website timryanforamerica.com Ryan campaigning at the 2019 Iowa State Fair After the 2018 midterms, Ryan was seen as a possible candidate for the 2020 presidential election.[27] In February and March 2019, he traveled to early primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.[28] Ryan's 2020 presidential campaign officially began on April 4, 2019, when he stated that he would run in the Democratic primaries.[29] He also announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination for president during an interview on The View.[30][31] After qualifying for only two debates and continuously polling below one per cent nationwide, Ryan formally withdrew from the race on October 24, 2019. Ryan intends to seek re-election for his seat in the House of Representatives.[32][33] Endorsements[edit] Main article: Endorsements in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries § Tim Ryan Publications[edit] In March 2012, Hay House published Ryan's A Mindful Nation,[34] a book about the practice of mindfulness in both private and public life. He writes in his introduction: If more citizens can reduce stress and increase performance—even if only by a little—they will be healthier and more resilient. They will be better equipped to face the challenges of daily life, and to arrive at creative solutions to the challenges facing our nation. In October 2014, the same publisher published Ryan's The Real Food Revolution.[citation needed] Personal life[edit] In 2013, Ryan married Andrea Zetts, a school teacher; they have lived in Howland Township near Warren, Ohio since that year.[35][36] In 2014, Ryan and Andrea Zetts had a son, Brady.[37] Ryan also lives with Zetts' two children from a previous relationship.[36] Electoral history[edit] Ohio's 17th congressional district: Results 2002–2010[38] Year Democrat Votes Pct Republican Votes Pct Other Party Votes Pct 2002 Timothy J.
